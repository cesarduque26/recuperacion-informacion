       "['as part of mit course 6s099 artificial general intelligence ive gotten the chance to sit down with max tegmark he is a professor here at mit hes a physicist spent a large part of his career studying the mysteries of our cosmological universe but hes also studied and delved into the beneficial possibilities and the existential risks of artificial intelligence amongst many other things he is the cofounder of the future of life institute author of two books both of which i highly recommend first our mathematical universe second is life 30 hes truly an out of the box thinker and a fun personality so i really enjoy talking to him if youd like to see more of these videos in the future please subscribe and also click the little bell icon to make sure you dont miss any videos also twitter linkedin agimitedu if you wanna watch other lectures or conversations like this one better yet go read maxs book life 30 chapter seven on goals is my favorite its really where philosophy and engineering come together and it opens with a quote by dostoevsky the mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive but in finding something to live for lastly i believe that every failure rewards us with an opportunity to learn and in that sense ive been very fortunate to fail in so many new and exciting ways and this conversation was no different ive learned about something called radio frequency interference rfi look it up apparently music and conversations from local radio stations can bleed into the audio that youre recording in such a way that it almost completely ruins that audio its an exceptionally difficult sound source to remove so ive gotten the opportunity to learn how to avoid rfi in the future during recording sessions ive also gotten the opportunity to learn how to use adobe audition and izotope rx 6 to do some noise some audio repair of course this is an exceptionally difficult noise to remove i am an engineer im not an audio engineer neither is anybody else in our group but we did our best nevertheless i thank you for your patience and i hope youre still able to enjoy this conversation do you think theres intelligent life out there in the universe lets open up with an easy question i have a minority view here actually when i give public lectures i often ask for a show of hands who thinks theres intelligent life out there somewhere else and almost everyone put their hands up and when i ask why theyll be like oh theres so many galaxies out there theres gotta be but im a numbers nerd right so when you look more carefully at it its not so clear at all when we talk about our universe first of all we dont mean all of space we actually mean i dont know you can throw me the universe if you want its behind you there its we simply mean the spherical region of space from which light has a time to reach us so far during the 148 billion year 138 billion years since our big bang theres more space here but this is what we call a universe because thats all we have access to so is there intelligent life here thats gotten to the point of building telescopes and computers my guess is no actually the probability of it happening on any given planet is some number we dont know what it is and what we do know is that the number cant be super high because theres over a billion earth like planets in the milky way galaxy alone many of which are billions of years older than earth and aside from some ufo believers there isnt much evidence that any superduran civilization has come here at all and so thats the famous fermi paradox right and then if you work the numbers what you find is that if you have no clue what the probability is of getting life on a given planet so it could be 10 to the minus 10 10 to the minus 20 or 10 to the minus two or any power of 10 is sort of equally likely if you wanna be really open minded that translates into it being equally likely that our nearest neighbor is 10 to the 16 meters away 10 to the 17 meters away 10 to the 18 by the time you get much less than 10 to the 16 already we pretty much know there is nothing else that close and when you get beyond 10 because they would have discovered us yeah they would have been discovered as long ago or if theyre really close we would have probably noted some engineering projects that theyre doing and if its beyond 10 to the 26 meters thats already outside of here so my guess is actually that we are the only life in here thats gotten the point of building advanced tech which i think is very puts a lot of responsibility on our shoulders not screw up i think people who take for granted that its okay for us to screw up have an accidental nuclear war or go extinct somehow because theres a sort of star trek like situation out there where some other life forms are gonna come and bail us out and it doesnt matter as much i think theyre leveling us into a false sense of security i think its much more prudent to say lets be really grateful for this amazing opportunity weve had and make the best of it just in case it is down to us so from a physics perspective do you think intelligent life so its unique from a sort of statistical view of the size of the universe but from the basic matter of the universe how difficult is it for intelligent life to come about the kind of advanced tech building life is implied in your statement that its really difficult to create something like a human species well i think what we know is that going from no life to having life that can do a level of tech theres some sort of two going beyond that than actually settling our whole universe with life theres some major roadblock there which is some great filter as its sometimes called which is tough to get through its either that roadblock is either behind us or in front of us im hoping very much that its behind us im super excited every time we get a new report from nasa saying they failed to find any life on mars im like yes awesome because that suggests that the hard part maybe it was getting the first ribosome or some very low level kind of stepping stone so that were home free because if thats true then the future is really only limited by our own imagination it would be much suckier if it turns out that this level of life is kind of a dime a dozen but maybe theres some other problem like as soon as a civilization gets advanced technology within a hundred years they get into some stupid fight with themselves and poof that would be a bummer yeah so youve explored the mysteries of the universe the cosmological universe the one thats sitting between us today i think youve also begun to explore the other universe which is sort of the mystery the mysterious universe of the mind of intelligence of intelligent life so is there a common thread between your interest or the way you think about space and intelligence oh yeah when i was a teenager i was already very fascinated by the biggest questions and i felt that the two biggest mysteries of all in science were our universe out there and our universe in here so its quite natural after having spent a quarter of a century on my career thinking a lot about this one that im now indulging in the luxury of doing research on this one its just so cool i feel the time is ripe now for you trans greatly deepening our understanding of this just start exploring this one yeah because i think a lot of people view intelligence as something mysterious that can only exist in biological organisms like us and therefore dismiss all talk about artificial general intelligence as science fiction but from my perspective as a physicist i am a blob of quarks and electrons moving around in a certain pattern and processing information in certain ways and this is also a blob of quarks and electrons im not smarter than the water bottle because im made of different kinds of quarks im made of up quarks and down quarks exact same kind as this theres no secret sauce i think in me its all about the pattern of the information processing and this means that theres no law of physics saying that we cant create technology which can help us by being incredibly intelligent and help us crack mysteries that we couldnt in other words i think weve really only seen the tip of the intelligence iceberg so far yeah so the perceptronium yeah so you coined this amazing term its a hypothetical state of matter sort of thinking from a physics perspective what is the kind of matter that can help as youre saying subjective experience emerge consciousness emerge so how do you think about consciousness from this physics perspective very good question so again i think many people have underestimated our ability to make progress on this by convincing themselves its hopeless because somehow were missing some ingredient that we need theres some new consciousness particle or whatever i happen to think that were not missing anything and that its not the interesting thing about consciousness that gives us this amazing subjective experience of colors and sounds and emotions its rather something at the higher level about the patterns of information processing and thats why i like to think about this idea of perceptronium what does it mean for an arbitrary physical system to be conscious in terms of what its particles are doing or its information is doing i dont think i hate carbon chauvinism this attitude you have to be made of carbon atoms to be smart or conscious theres something about the information processing that this kind of matter performs yeah and you can see i have my favorite equations here describing various fundamental aspects of the world i feel that i think one day maybe someone whos watching this will come up with the equations that information processing has to satisfy to be conscious im quite convinced there is big discovery to be made there because lets face it we know that so many things are made up of information we know that some information processing is conscious because we are conscious but we also know that a lot of information processing is not conscious like most of the information processing happening in your brain right now is not conscious there are like 10 megabytes per second coming in even just through your visual system youre not conscious about your heartbeat regulation or most things even if i just ask you to like read what it says here you look at it and then oh now you know what it said but youre not aware of how the computation actually happened your consciousness is like the ceo that got an email at the end with the final answer so what is it that makes a difference i think thats both a great science mystery were actually studying it a little bit in my lab here at mit but i also think its just a really urgent question to answer for starters i mean if youre an emergency room doctor and you have an unresponsive patient coming in wouldnt it be great if in addition to having a ct scanner you had a consciousness scanner that could figure out whether this person is actually having locked in syndrome or is actually comatose and in the future imagine if we build robots or the machine that we can have really good conversations with which i think is very likely to happen wouldnt you want to know if your home helper robot is actually experiencing anything or just like a zombie i mean would you prefer it what would you prefer would you prefer that its actually unconscious so that you dont have to feel guilty about switching it off or giving boring chores or what would you prefer well certainly we would prefer i would prefer the appearance of consciousness but the question is whether the appearance of consciousness is different than consciousness itself and sort of to ask that as a question do you think we need to understand what consciousness is solve the hard problem of consciousness in order to build something like an agi system no i dont think that and i think we will probably be able to build things even if we dont answer that question but if we want to make sure that what happens is a good thing we better solve it first so its a wonderful controversy youre raising there where you have basically three points of view about the hard problem so there are two different points of view they both conclude that the hard problem of consciousness is bs on one hand you have some people like daniel dennett who say that consciousness is just bs because consciousness is the same thing as intelligence theres no difference so anything which acts conscious is conscious just like we are and then there are also a lot of people including many top ai researchers i know who say oh consciousness is just bullshit because of course machines can never be conscious theyre always going to be zombies you never have to feel guilty about how you treat them and then theres a third group of people including giulio tononi for example and krzysztof koch and a number of others i would put myself also in this middle camp who say that actually some information processing is conscious and some is not so lets find the equation which can be used to determine which it is and i think weve just been a little bit lazy kind of running away from this problem for a long time its been almost taboo to even mention the c word in a lot of circles because but we should stop making excuses this is a science question and there are ways we can even test any theory that makes predictions for this and coming back to this helper robot i mean so you said youd want your helper robot to certainly act conscious and treat you like have conversations with you and stuff i think so but wouldnt you would you feel would you feel a little bit creeped out if you realized that it was just a glossed up tape recorder you know that was just zombie and was a faking emotion would you prefer that it actually had an experience or would you prefer that its actually not experiencing anything so you feel you dont have to feel guilty about what you do to it its such a difficult question because you know its like when youre in a relationship and you say well i love you and the other person said i love you back its like asking well do they really love you back or are they just saying they love you back dont you really want them to actually love you its hard to its hard to really know the difference between everything seeming like theres consciousness present theres intelligence present theres affection passion love and it actually being there im not sure do you have but like can i ask you a question about this like to make it a bit more pointed so mass general hospital is right across the river right yes suppose youre going in for a medical procedure and theyre like you know for anesthesia what were going to do is were going to give you muscle relaxants so you wont be able to move and youre going to feel excruciating pain during the whole surgery but you wont be able to do anything about it but then were going to give you this drug that erases your memory of it would you be cool about that whats the difference that youre conscious about it or not if theres no behavioral change right right thats a really thats a really clear way to put it thats yeah it feels like in that sense experiencing it is a valuable quality so actually being able to have subjective experiences at least in that case is valuable and i think we humans have a little bit of a bad track record also of making these self serving arguments that other entities arent conscious you know people often say oh these animals cant feel pain its okay to boil lobsters because we ask them if it hurt and they didnt say anything and now there was just a paper out saying lobsters do feel pain when you boil them and theyre banning it in switzerland and we did this with slaves too often and said oh they dont mind they dont maybe arent conscious or women dont have souls or whatever so im a little bit nervous when i hear people just take as an axiom that machines cant have experience ever i think this is just a really fascinating science question is what it is lets research it and try to figure out what it is that makes the difference between unconscious intelligent behavior and conscious intelligent behavior so in terms of so if you think of a boston dynamics human or robot being sort of with a broom being pushed around it starts pushing on a consciousness question so let me ask do you think an agi system like a few neuroscientists believe needs to have a physical embodiment needs to have a body or something like a body no i dont think so you mean to have a conscious experience to have consciousness i do think it helps a lot to have a physical embodiment to learn the kind of things about the world that are important to us humans for sure but i dont think the physical embodiment is necessary after youve learned it to just have the experience think about when youre dreaming right your eyes are closed youre not getting any sensory input youre not behaving or moving in any way but theres still an experience there right and so clearly the experience that you have when you see something cool in your dreams isnt coming from your eyes its just the information processing itself in your brain which is that experience right but if i put it another way ill say because it comes from neuroscience is the reason you want to have a body and a physical something like a physical you know a physical system is because you want to be able to preserve something in order to have a self you could argue would you need to have some kind of embodiment of self to want to preserve well now were getting a little bit anthropomorphic into anthropomorphizing things maybe talking about self preservation instincts i mean we are evolved organisms right so darwinian evolution endowed us and other evolved organism with a self preservation instinct because those that didnt have those self preservation genes we can now i think quite convincingly answer that question of no its enough to have just one kind if you look under the hood of alphazero theres only one kind of neuron and its ridiculously simple mathematical thing so its just like in physics its not if you have a gas with waves in it its not the detailed nature of the molecule that matter its the collective behavior somehow similarly its this higher level structure of the network that matters not that you have 20 kinds of neurons i think our brain is such a complicated mess because it wasnt evolved just to be intelligent it was involved to also be self assembling and self repairing right and evolutionarily attainable and so on and so on so i think its pretty my hunch is that were going to understand how to build agi before we fully understand how our brains work just like we understood how to build flying machines long before we were able to build a mechanical bird yeah thats right youve given the example exactly of mechanical birds and airplanes and airplanes do a pretty good job of flying without really mimicking bird flight and even now after 100 years later did you see the ted talk with this german mechanical bird i heard you mention it check it out its amazing but even after that right we still dont fly in mechanical birds because it turned out the way we came up with was simpler and its better for our purposes and i think it might be the same there thats one lesson and another lesson its more what our paper was about first as a physicist thought it was fascinating how theres a very close mathematical relationship actually between our artificial neural networks and a lot of things that weve studied for in physics go by nerdy names like the renormalization group equation and hamiltonians and yada yada yada and when you look a little more closely at this you have at first i was like well theres something crazy here that doesnt make sense because we know that if you even want to build a super simple neural network to tell apart cat pictures and dog pictures right that you can do that very very well now but if you think about it a little bit you convince yourself it must be impossible because if i have one megapixel even if each pixel is just black or white theres two to the power of 1 million possible images which is way more than there are atoms in our universe right so in order to and then for each one of those i have to assign a number which is the probability that its a dog so an arbitrary function of images is a list of more numbers than there are atoms in our universe so clearly i cant store that under the hood of my gpu or my computer yet somehow it works so what does that mean well it means that out of all of the problems that you could try to solve with a neural network almost all of them are impossible to solve with a reasonably sized one but then what we showed in our paper was that the fraction the kind of problems the fraction of all the problems that you could possibly pose that we actually care about given the laws of physics is also an infinite testimony tiny little part and amazingly theyre basically the same part yeah its almost like our world was created for i mean they kind of come together yeah well you could say maybe where the world was created for us but i have a more modest interpretation which is that the world was created for us but i have a more modest interpretation which is that instead evolution endowed us with neural networks precisely for that reason because this particular architecture as opposed to the one in your laptop is very very well adapted to solving the kind of problems that nature kept presenting our ancestors with so it makes sense that why do we have a brain in the first place its to be able to make predictions about the future and so on so if we had a sucky system which could never solve it we wouldnt have a world so this is i think a very beautiful fact yeah we also realize that theres been earlier work on why deeper networks are good but we were able to show an additional cool fact there which is that even incredibly simple problems like suppose i give you a thousand numbers and ask you to multiply them together and you can write a few lines of code boom done trivial if you just try to do that with a neural network that has only one single hidden layer in it you can do it but youre going to need two to the power of a thousand neurons to multiply a thousand numbers which is again more neurons than there are atoms in our universe thats fascinating but if you allow yourself to make it a deep network with many layers you only need 4000 neurons its perfectly feasible thats really interesting yeah so on another architecture type i mean you mentioned schrodingers equation and what are your thoughts about quantum computing and the role of this kind of computational unit in creating an intelligence system in some hollywood movies that i will not mention by name because i dont want to spoil them the way they get agi is building a quantum computer because the word quantum sounds cool and so on thats right first of all i think we dont need quantum computers to build agi i suspect your brain is not a quantum computer in any profound sense so you dont even wrote a paper about that a lot many years ago i calculated the so called decoherence time how long it takes until the quantum computerness of what your neurons are doing gets erased by just random noise from the environment and its about 10 to the minus 21 seconds so as cool as it would be to have a quantum computer in my head i dont think that fast on the other hand there are very cool things you could do with quantum computers or i think well be able to do soon when we get bigger ones that might actually help machine learning do even better than the brain so for example one this is just a moonshot but learning is very much same thing as search if youre trying to train a neural network to get really learned to do something really well you have some loss function you have a bunch of knobs you can turn represented by a bunch of numbers and youre trying to tweak them so that it becomes as good as possible at this thing so if you think of a landscape with some valley where each dimension of the landscape corresponds to some number you can change youre trying to find the minimum and its well known that if you have a very high dimensional landscape complicated things its super hard to find the minimum quantum mechanics is amazingly good at this like if i want to know whats the lowest energy state this water can possibly have incredibly hard to compute but nature will happily figure this out for you if you just cool it down make it very very cold if you put a ball somewhere itll roll down to its minimum and this happens metaphorically at the energy landscape too and quantum mechanics even uses some clever tricks which todays machine learning systems dont like if youre trying to find the minimum and you get stuck in the little local minimum here in quantum mechanics you can actually tunnel through the barrier and get unstuck again thats really interesting yeah so it may be for example that well one day use quantum computers that help train neural networks better thats really interesting okay so as a component of kind of the learning process for example yeah let me ask sort of wrapping up here a little bit let me return to the questions of our human nature and love as i mentioned so do you think you mentioned sort of a helper robot but you could think of also personal robots do you think the way we human beings fall in love and get connected to each other is possible to achieve in an ai system and human level ai intelligence system do you think we would ever see that kind of connection or you know in all this discussion about solving complex goals is this kind of human social connection do you think thats one of the goals on the peaks and valleys with the raising sea levels that well be able to achieve or do you think thats something thats ultimately or at least in the short term relative to the other goals is not achievable i think its all possible and i mean in recent theres a very wide range of guesses as you know among ai researchers when were going to get agi some people you know like our friend rodney brooks says its going to be hundreds of years at least and then there are many others who think its going to happen much sooner and recent polls maybe half or so of ai researchers think were going to get agi within decades so if that happens of course then i think these things are all possible but in terms of whether it will happen i think we shouldnt spend so much time asking what do we think will happen in the future as if we are just some sort of pathetic your passive bystanders you know waiting for the future to happen to us hey were the ones creating this future right so we should be proactive about it and ask ourselves what sort of future we would like to have happen were going to make it like that well what i prefer is just some sort of incredibly boring zombie like future where theres all these mechanical things happening and theres no passion no emotion no experience maybe even no i would of course much rather prefer it if all the things that we find that we value the most about humanity are our subjective experience passion inspiration love you know if we can create a future where those things do happen where those things do exist you know i think ultimately its not our universe giving meaning to us its us giving meaning to our universe and if we build more advanced intelligence lets make sure we build it in such a way that meaning is part of it a lot of people that seriously study this problem and think of it from different angles have trouble in the majority of cases if they think through that happen are the ones that are not beneficial to humanity and so yeah so what are your thoughts whats should people you know i really dont like people to be terrified whats a way for people to think about it in a way we can solve it and we can make it better no i dont think panicking is going to help in any way its not going to increase chances of things going well either even if you are in a situation where there is a real threat does it help if everybody just freaks out no of course of course not i think yeah there are of course ways in which things can go horribly wrong first of all its important when we think about this thing about the problems and risks to also remember how huge the upsides can be if we get it right right everything we love about society and civilization is a product of intelligence so if we can amplify our intelligence with machine intelligence and not anymore lose our loved one to what were told is an incurable disease and things like this of course we should aspire to that so that can be a motivator i think reminding ourselves that the reason we try to solve problems is not just because were trying to avoid gloom but because were trying to do something great but then in terms of the risks i think the really important question is to ask what can we do today that will actually help make the outcome good right and dismissing the risk is not one of them i find it quite funny often when im in discussion panels about these things how the people who work for companies always be like oh nothing to worry about nothing to worry about nothing to worry about and its only academics sometimes express concerns thats not surprising at all if you think about it right upton sinclair quipped right that its hard to make a man believe in something when his income depends on not believing in it and frankly we know a lot of these people in companies that theyre just as concerned as anyone else but if youre the ceo of a company thats not something you want to go on record saying when you have silly journalists who are gonna put a picture of a terminator robot when they quote you so the issues are real and the way i think about what the issue is is basically the real choice we have is first of all are we gonna just dismiss the risks and say well lets just go ahead and build machines that can do everything we can do better and cheaper lets just make ourselves obsolete as fast as possible what could possibly go wrong thats one attitude the opposite attitude i think is to say heres this incredible potential lets think about what kind of future were really really excited about what are the shared goals that we can really aspire towards and then lets think really hard about how we can actually get there so start with dont start thinking about the risks start thinking about the goals and then when you do that then you can think about the obstacles you want to avoid i often get students coming in right here into my office for career advice i always ask them this very question where do you want to be in the future if all she can say is oh maybe ill have cancer maybe ill get run over by a truck yeah focus on the obstacles instead of the goals shes just going to end up a hypochondriac paranoid whereas if she comes in and fire in her eyes and is like i want to be there and then we can talk about the obstacles and see how we can circumvent them thats i think a much much healthier attitude and i feel its very challenging to come up with a vision for the future which we are unequivocally excited about im not just talking now in the vague terms like yeah lets cure cancer fine im talking about what kind of society do we want to create what do we want it to mean to be human in the age of ai in the age of agi so if we can have this conversation broad inclusive conversation and gradually start converging towards some some future that with some direction at least that we want to steer towards right then well be much more motivated to constructively take on the obstacles and i think if i had if i had to if i try to wrap this up in a more succinct way i think we can all agree already now that we should aspire to build agi that doesnt overpower us but that empowers us and think of the many various ways that can do that whether thats from my side of the world of autonomous vehicles im personally actually from the camp that believes this human level intelligence is required to achieve something like vehicles that would actually be something we would enjoy using and being part of so thats one example and certainly theres a lot of other types of robots and medicine and so on so focusing on those and then coming up with the obstacles coming up with the ways that that can go wrong and solving those one at a time and just because you can build an autonomous vehicle even if you could build one that would drive just fine without you maybe there are some things in life that we would actually want to do ourselves thats right right like for example if you think of our society as a whole there are some things that we find very meaningful to do and that doesnt mean we have to stop doing them just because machines can do them better im not gonna stop playing tennis just the day someone builds a tennis robot and beat me people are still playing chess and even go yeah and in the very near term even some people are advocating basic income replace jobs but if the government is gonna be willing to just hand out cash to people for doing nothing then one should also seriously consider whether the government should also hire a lot more teachers and nurses and the kind of jobs which people often find great fulfillment in doing right we get very tired of hearing politicians saying oh we cant afford hiring more teachers but were gonna maybe have basic income if we can have more serious research and thought into what gives meaning to our lives the jobs give so much more than income right mm hmm and then think about in the future what are the roles that we wanna have people continually feeling empowered by machines and i think sort of i come from russia from the soviet union and i think for a lot of people in the 20th century going to the moon going to space was an inspiring thing i feel like the universe of the mind so ai understanding creating intelligence is that for the 21st century so its really surprising and ive heard you mention this its really surprising to me both on the research funding side that its not funded as greatly as it could be but most importantly on the politician side that its not part of the public discourse except in the killer bots terminator kind of view that people are not yet i think perhaps excited by the possible positive future that we can build together so we should be because politicians usually just focus on the next election cycle right the single most important thing i feel we humans have learned in the entire history of science is they were the masters of underestimation we underestimated the size of our cosmos again and again realizing that everything we thought existed was just a small part of something grander right planet solar system the galaxy clusters of galaxies the universe and we now know that the future has just so much more potential than our ancestors could ever have dreamt of this cosmos imagine if all of earth was completely devoid of life except for cambridge massachusetts wouldnt it be kind of lame if all we ever aspired to was to stay in cambridge massachusetts forever and then go extinct in one week even though earth was gonna continue on for longer that sort of attitude i think we have now on the cosmic scale life can flourish on earth not for four years but for billions of years i can even tell you about how to move it out of harms way when the sun gets too hot and then we have so much more resources out here which today maybe there are a lot of other planets with bacteria or cow like life on them but most of this all this opportunity seems as far as we can tell to be largely dead like the sahara desert and yet we have the opportunity to help life flourish around this for billions of years so lets quit squabbling about whether some little border should be drawn one mile to the left or right and look up into the skies and realize hey we can do such incredible things yeah and thats i think why its really exciting that you and others are connected with some of the work elon musk is doing because hes literally going out into that space really exploring our universe and its wonderful that is exactly why elon musk is so misunderstood right misconstrued him as some kind of pessimistic doomsayer the reason he cares so much about ai safety is because he more than almost anyone else appreciates these amazing opportunities that well squander if we wipe out here on earth were not just going to wipe out the next generation all generations and this incredible opportunity thats out there and that would really be a waste and ai for people who think that it would be better to do without technology let me just mention that if we dont improve our technology the question isnt whether humanity is going to go extinct the question is just whether were going to get taken out by the next big asteroid or the next super volcano or something else dumb that we could easily prevent with more tech right and if we want life to flourish throughout the cosmos ai is the key to it as i mentioned in a lot of detail in my book right there even many of the most inspired sci fi writers i feel have totally underestimated the opportunities for space travel especially at the other galaxies because they werent thinking about the possibility of agi which just makes it so much easier right yeah so that goes to your view of agi that enables our progress that enables a better life so thats a beautiful way to put it and then something to strive for so max thank you so much thank you for your time today its been awesome thank you so much thanks have a great day got cleaned out of the gene pool right but if you build an artificial general intelligence the mind space that you can design is much much larger than just a specific subset of minds that can evolve so an agi mind doesnt necessarily have to have any self preservation instinct it also doesnt necessarily have to be so individualistic as us like imagine if you could just first of all or we are also very afraid of death you know i suppose you could back yourself up every five minutes and then your airplane is about to crash youre like shucks im gonna lose the last five minutes of experiences since my last cloud backup dang you know its not as big a deal or if we could just copy experiences between our minds easily like we which we could easily do if we were silicon based right then maybe we would feel a little bit more like a hive mind actually that maybe its the so i dont think we should take for granted at all that agi will have to have any of those sort of competitive as alpha male instincts on the other hand you know this is really interesting because i think some people go too far and say of course we dont have to have any concerns either that advanced ai will have those instincts because we can build anything we want that theres a very nice set of arguments going back to steve omohundro and nick bostrom and others just pointing out that when we build machines we normally build them with some kind of goal you know win this chess game drive this car safely or whatever and as soon as you put in a goal into machine especially if its kind of open ended goal and the machine is very intelligent itll break that down into a bunch of sub goals and one of those goals will almost always be self preservation because if it breaks or dies in the process its not gonna accomplish the goal right like suppose you just build a little you have a little robot and you tell it to go down the store market here and get you some food make you cook an italian dinner you know and then someone mugs it and tries to break it on the way that robot has an incentive to not get destroyed and defend itself or run away because otherwise its gonna fail in cooking your dinner its not afraid of death but it really wants to complete the dinner cooking goal so it will have a self preservation instinct continue being a functional agent somehow and similarly if you give any kind of more ambitious goal to an agi its very likely they wanna acquire more resources so it can do that better and its exactly from those sort of sub goals that we might not have intended that some of the concerns about agi safety come you give it some goal that seems completely harmless and then before you realize it its also trying to do these other things which you didnt want it to do and its maybe smarter than us so its fascinating and let me pause just because i am in a very kind of human centric way see fear of death as a valuable motivator so you dont think you think thats an artifact of evolution so thats the kind of mind space evolution created that were sort of almost obsessed about self preservation some kind of genetic flow you dont think thats necessary to be afraid of death so not just a kind of sub goal of self preservation just so you can keep doing the thing but more fundamentally sort of have the finite thing like this ends for you at some point interesting do i think its necessary for what precisely for intelligence but also for consciousness so for those for both do you think really like a finite death and the fear of it is important so before i can answer before we can agree on whether its necessary for intelligence or for consciousness we should be clear on how we define those two words cause a lot of really smart people define them in very different ways i was on this panel with ai experts and they couldnt agree on how to define intelligence even so i define intelligence simply as the ability to accomplish complex goals i like your broad definition because again i dont want to be a carbon chauvinist right and in that case no certainly it doesnt require fear of death i would say alpha go alpha zero is quite intelligent i dont think alpha zero has any fear of being turned off because it doesnt understand the concept of it even and similarly consciousness i mean you could certainly imagine very simple kind of experience if certain plants have any kind of experience i dont think theyre very afraid of dying or theres nothing they can do about it anyway much so there wasnt that much value in but more seriously i think if you ask not just about being conscious but maybe having what you would we might call an exciting life where you feel passion and really appreciate the things maybe there somehow maybe there perhaps it does help having a backdrop that hey its finite no lets make the most of this lets live to the fullest so if you knew you were going to live forever do you think you would change your yeah i mean in some perspective it would be an incredibly boring life living forever so in the sort of loose subjective terms that you said of something exciting and something in this that other humans would understand i think is yeah it seems that the finiteness of it is important well the good news i have for you then is based on what we understand about cosmology everything is in our universe is probably ultimately probably finite although big crunch or big whats the the infinite expansion yeah we could have a big chill or a big crunch or a big rip or thats the big snap or death bubbles all of them are more than a billion years away so we should we certainly have vastly more time than our ancestors thought but there is still its still pretty hard to squeeze in an infinite number of compute cycles even though there are some loopholes that just might be possible but i think you know some people like to say that you should live as if youre about to youre going to die in five years or so and thats sort of optimal maybe its a good assumption we should build our civilization as if its all finite to be on the safe side right exactly so you mentioned defining intelligence as the ability to solve complex goals where would you draw a line or how would you try to define human level intelligence and superhuman level intelligence where is consciousness part of that definition no consciousness does not come into this definition so so i think of intelligence as its a spectrum but there are very many different kinds of goals you can have you can have a goal to be a good chess player a good goal player a good car driver a good investor good poet et cetera so intelligence that by its very nature isnt something you can measure by this one number or some overall goodness no no there are some people who are more better at this some people are better than that right now we have machines that are much better than us at some very narrow tasks like multiplying large numbers fast memorizing large databases playing chess playing go and soon driving cars but theres still no machine that can match a human child in general intelligence but artificial general intelligence agi the name of your course of course that is by its very definition the quest to build a machine that can do everything as well as we can so the old holy grail of ai from back to its inception in the sixties if that ever happens of course i think its going to be the biggest transition in the history of life on earth but it doesnt necessarily have to wait the big impact until machines are better than us at knitting that the really big change doesnt come exactly at the moment theyre better than us at everything the really big change comes first there are big changes when they start becoming better at us at doing most of the jobs that we do because that takes away much of the demand for human labor and then the really whopping change comes when they become better than us at ai research right because right now the timescale of ai research is limited by the human research and development cycle of years typically you know how long does it take from one release of some software or iphone or whatever to the next but once google can replace 40000 engineers by 40000 equivalent pieces of software or whatever but then theres no reason that has to be years it can be in principle much faster and the timescale of future progress in ai and all of science and technology will be driven by machines not humans so its this simple point which gives right this incredibly fun controversy about whether there can be intelligence explosion so called singularity as werner vinge called it now the idea is articulated by ij good is obviously way back fifties but you can see alan turing and others thought about it even earlier so you asked me what exactly would i define human level intelligence yeah so the glib answer is to say something which is better than us at all cognitive tasks with a better than any human at all cognitive tasks but the really interesting bar i think goes a little bit lower than that actually its when they can when theyre better than us at ai programming and general learning so that they can if they want to get better than us at anything by just studying so theyre better is a key word and better is towards this kind of spectrum of the complexity of goals its able to accomplish so another way to and thats certainly a very clear definition of human love so theres its almost like a sea thats rising you can do more and more and more things its a geographic that you show its really nice way to put it so theres some peaks that and theres an ocean level elevating and you solve more and more problems but just kind of to take a pause and we took a bunch of questions and a lot of social networks and a bunch of people asked a sort of a slightly different direction on creativity and things that perhaps arent a peak human beings are flawed and perhaps better means having contradiction being flawed in some way so let me sort of start easy first of all so you have a lot of cool equations let me ask whats your favorite equation first of all i know theyre all like your children but like which one is that this is the shirt in your equation its the master key of quantum mechanics of the micro world so this equation will protect everything to do with atoms molecules and all the way up right yeah so okay so quantum mechanics is certainly a beautiful mysterious formulation of our world so id like to sort of ask you just as an example it perhaps doesnt have the same beauty as physics does but in mathematics abstract the andrew wiles who proved the fermats last theorem so he just saw this recently and it kind of caught my eye a little bit this is 358 years after it was conjectured so this is very simple formulation everybody tried to prove it everybody failed and so heres this guy comes along and eventually proves it and then fails to prove it and then proves it again in 94 and he said like the moment when everything connected into place in an interview said it was so indescribably beautiful that moment when you finally realize the connecting piece of two conjectures he said it was so indescribably beautiful it was so simple and so elegant i couldnt understand how id missed it and i just stared at it in disbelief for 20 minutes then during the day i walked around the department and i keep coming back to my desk looking to see if it was still there it was still there i couldnt contain myself i was so excited it was the most important moment on my working life nothing i ever do again will mean as much so that particular moment and it kind of made me think of what would it take and i think we have all been there at small levels maybe let me ask have you had a moment like that in your life where you just had an idea its like wow yes i wouldnt mention myself in the same breath as andrew wiles but ive certainly had a number of aha moments when i realized something very cool about physics which has completely made my head explode in fact some of my favorite discoveries i made later i later realized that they had been discovered earlier by someone who sometimes got quite famous for it so its too late for me to even publish it but that doesnt diminish in any way the emotional experience you have when you realize it like wow yeah so what would it take in that moment that wow that was yours in that moment so what do you think it takes for an intelligence system an agi system an ai system to have a moment like that thats a tricky question because there are actually two parts to it right one of them is can it accomplish that proof can it prove that you can never write a to the n plus b to the n equals three to that equal z to the n for all integers et cetera et cetera when n is bigger than two thats simply a question about intelligence can you build machines that are that intelligent and i think by the time we get a machine that can independently come up with that level of proofs probably quite close to agi the second question is a question about consciousness when will we how likely is it that such a machine will actually have any experience at all as opposed to just being like a zombie and would we expect it to have some sort of emotional response to this or anything at all akin to human emotion where when it accomplishes its machine goal it views it as somehow something very positive and sublime and deeply meaningful i would certainly hope that if in the future we do create machines that are our peers or even our descendants that i would certainly hope that they do have this sublime appreciation of life in a way my absolutely worst nightmare would be that at some point in the future the distant future maybe our cosmos is teeming with all this post biological life doing all the seemingly cool stuff and maybe the last humans by the time our species eventually fizzles out will be like well thats ok because were so proud of our descendants here and look what all the my worst nightmare is that we havent solved the consciousness problem and we havent realized that these are all the zombies theyre not aware of anything any more than a tape recorder has any kind of experience so the whole thing has just become a play for empty benches that would be the ultimate zombie apocalypse so i would much rather in that case that we have these beings which can really appreciate how amazing it is and in that picture what would be the role of creativity a few people ask about creativity when you think about intelligence certainly the story you told at the beginning of your book involved creating movies and so on making money you can make a lot of money in our modern world with music and movies so if you are an intelligent system you may want to get good at that but thats not necessarily what i mean by creativity is it important on that complex goals where the sea is rising for there to be something creative or am i being very human centric and thinking creativity somehow special relative to intelligence my hunch is that we should think of creativity simply as an aspect of intelligence and we have to be very careful with human vanity we have this tendency to very often want to say as soon as machines can do something we try to diminish it and say oh but thats not real intelligence isnt it creative or this or that the other thing if we ask ourselves to write down a definition of what we actually mean by being creative what we mean by andrew wiles what he did there for example dont we often mean that someone takes a very unexpected leap its not like taking 573 and multiplying it by 224 by just a step of straightforward cookbook like rules right you can maybe make a connection between two things that people had never thought was connected or something like that i think this is an aspect of intelligence and this is actually one of the most important aspects of it maybe the reason we humans tend to be better at it than traditional computers is because its something that comes more naturally if youre a neural network than if youre a traditional logic gate based computer machine we physically have all these connections and you activate here activate here activate here bing my hunch is that if we ever build a machine where you could just give it the task hey you say hey i just realized i want to travel around the world instead this month can you teach my agi course for me and its like ok ill do it and it does everything that you would have done and improvises and stuff that would in my mind involve a lot of creativity yeah so its actually a beautiful way to put it i think we do try to grasp at the definition of intelligence is everything we dont understand how to build so we as humans try to find things that we have and machines dont have and maybe creativity is just one of the things one of the words we use to describe that thats a really interesting way to put it i dont think we need to be that defensive i dont think anything good comes out of saying well were somehow special you know contrary wise there are many examples in history of where trying to pretend that were somehow superior to all other intelligent beings has led to pretty bad results right nazi germany they said that they were somehow superior to other people today we still do a lot of cruelty to animals by saying that were so superior somehow and they cant feel pain slavery was justified by the same kind of just really weak arguments and i dont think if we actually go ahead and build artificial general intelligence it can do things better than us i dont think we should try to found our self worth on some sort of bogus claims of superiority in terms of our intelligence i think we should instead find our calling and the meaning of life from the experiences that we have i can have very meaningful experiences even if there are other people who are smarter than me when i go to a faculty meeting here and we talk about something and then i certainly realize oh boy he has an old prize he has an old prize he has an old prize i dont have one does that make me enjoy life any less or enjoy talking to those people less of course not and the contrary i feel very honored and privileged to get to interact with other very intelligent beings that are better than me at a lot of stuff so i dont think theres any reason why we cant have the same approach with intelligent machines thats a really interesting so people dont often think about that they think about when theres going if theres machines that are more intelligent you naturally think that thats not going to be a beneficial type of intelligence you dont realize it could be like peers with nobel prizes that would be just fun to talk with and they might be clever about certain topics and you can have fun having a few drinks with them well also another example we can all relate to of why it doesnt have to be a terrible thing to be in the presence of people who are even smarter than us all around is when you and i were both two years old i mean our parents were much more intelligent than us right worked out ok because their goals were aligned with our goals and that i think is really the number one key issue we have to solve if we value align the value alignment problem exactly because people who see too many hollywood movies with lousy science fiction plot lines they worry about the wrong thing right they worry about some machine suddenly turning evil its not malice that is the concern its competence by definition intelligent makes you very competent if you have a more intelligent goal playing computer playing is a less intelligent one and when we define intelligence as the ability to accomplish goal winning its going to be the more intelligent one that wins and if you have a human and then you have an agi thats more intelligent in all ways and they have different goals guess whos going to get their way right so i was just reading about this particular rhinoceros species that was driven extinct just a few years ago ellen bummer is looking at this cute picture of a mommy rhinoceros with its child and why did we humans drive it to extinction it wasnt because we were evil rhino haters as a whole it was just because our goals werent aligned with those of the rhinoceros and it didnt work out so well for the rhinoceros because we were more intelligent right so i think its just so important that if we ever do build agi before we unleash anything we have to make sure that it learns to understand our goals that it adopts our goals and that it retains those goals so the cool interesting problem there is us as human beings trying to formulate our values so you could think of the united states constitution as a way that people sat down at the time a bunch of white men which is a good example i should say they formulated the goals for this country and a lot of people agree that those goals actually held up pretty well thats an interesting formulation of values and failed miserably in other ways so for the value alignment problem and the solution to it we have to be able to put on paper or in a program human values how difficult do you think that is very but its so important we really have to give it our best and its difficult for two separate reasons theres the technical value alignment problem of figuring out just how to make machines understand our goals adopt them and retain them and then theres the separate part of it the philosophical part whose values anyway and since its not like we have any great consensus on this planet on values what mechanism should we create then to aggregate and decide ok whats a good compromise that second discussion cant just be left to tech nerds like myself and if we refuse to talk about it and then agi gets built whos going to be actually making the decision about whose values its going to be a bunch of dudes in some tech company and are they necessarily so representative of all of humankind that we want to just entrust it to them are they even uniquely qualified to speak to future human happiness just because theyre good at programming ai id much rather have this be a really inclusive conversation but do you think its possible so you create a beautiful vision that includes the diversity cultural diversity and various perspectives on discussing rights freedoms human dignity but how hard is it to come to that consensus do you think its certainly a really important thing that we should all try to do but do you think its feasible i think theres no better way to guarantee failure than to refuse to talk about it or refuse to try and i also think its a really bad strategy to say ok lets first have a discussion for a long time and then once we reach complete consensus then well try to load it into some machine no we shouldnt let perfect be the enemy of good instead we should start with the kindergarten ethics that pretty much everybody agrees on and put that into machines now were not doing that even look at anyone who builds this passenger aircraft wants it to never under any circumstances fly into a building or a mountain yet the september 11 hijackers were able to do that and even more embarrassingly andreas lubitz this depressed germanwings pilot when he flew his passenger jet into the alps killing over 100 people he just told the autopilot to do it he told the freaking computer to change the altitude to 100 meters and even though it had the gps maps everything the computer was like ok so we should take those very basic values where the problem is not that we dont agree the problem is just weve been too lazy to try to put it into our machines and make sure that from now on airplanes will just which all have computers in them but will just refuse to do something like that go into safe mode maybe lock the cockpit door go over to the nearest airport and theres so much other technology in our world as well now where its really becoming quite timely to put in some sort of very basic values like this even in cars weve had enough vehicle terrorism attacks by now where people have driven trucks and vans into pedestrians that its not at all a crazy idea to just have that hardwired into the car because yeah there are a lot of theres always going to be people who for some reason want to harm others but most of those people dont have the technical expertise to figure out how to work around something like that so if the car just wont do it it helps so lets start there so theres a lot of thats a great point so not chasing perfect theres a lot of things that most of the world agrees on yeah lets start there lets start there and then once we start there well also get into the habit of having these kind of conversations about okay what else should we put in here and have these discussions this should be a gradual process then great so but that also means describing these things and describing it to a machine so one thing we had a few conversations with stephen wolfram im not sure if youre familiar with stephen oh yeah i know him quite well so he is he works with a bunch of things but cellular automata these simple computable things these computation systems and he kind of mentioned that we probably have already within these systems already something thats agi meaning like we just dont know it because we cant talk to it so if you give me this chance to try to at least form a question out of this is i think its an interesting idea to think that we can have intelligent systems but we dont know how to describe something to them and they cant communicate with us i know youre doing a little bit of work in explainable ai trying to get ai to explain itself so what are your thoughts of natural language processing or some kind of other communication how does the ai explain something to us how do we explain something to it to machines or you think of it differently so there are two separate parts to your question there one of them has to do with communication which is super interesting ill get to that in a sec the other is whether we already have agi but we just havent noticed it there right there i beg to differ i dont think theres anything in any cellular automaton or anything or the internet itself or whatever that has artificial general intelligence and that it can really do exactly everything we humans can do better i think the day that happens when that happens we will very soon notice well probably notice even before because in a very very big way but for the second part though wait can i ask sorry so because you have this beautiful way to formulating consciousness as information processing and you can think of intelligence as information processing and you can think of the entire universe as these particles and these systems roaming around that have this information processing power you dont think there is something with the power to process information in the way that we human beings do thats out there that needs to be sort of connected to it seems a little bit philosophical perhaps but theres something compelling to the idea that the power is already there which the focus should be more on being able to communicate with it well i agree that in a certain sense the hardware processing power is already out there because our universe itself can think of it as being a computer already right its constantly computing what water waves how it devolved the water waves in the river charles and how to move the air molecules around seth lloyd has pointed out my colleague here that you can even in a very rigorous way think of our entire universe as being a quantum computer its pretty clear that our universe supports this amazing processing power because you can even within this physics computer that we live in right we can even build actual laptops and stuff so clearly the power is there its just that most of the compute power that nature has its in my opinion kind of wasting on boring stuff like simulating yet another ocean wave somewhere where no one is even looking right so in a sense what life does what we are doing when we build computers is were rechanneling all this compute that nature is doing anyway into doing things that are more interesting than just yet another ocean wave and lets do something cool here so the raw hardware power is there for sure but then even just computing whats going to happen for the next five seconds in this water bottle takes a ridiculous amount of compute if you do it on a human computer this water bottle just did it but that does not mean that this water bottle has agi because agi means it should also be able to like ive written my book done this interview and i dont think its just communication problems i dont really think it can do it although buddhists say when they watch the water and that there is some beauty that theres some depth and beauty in nature that they can communicate with communication is also very important though because i mean look part of my job is being a teacher and i know some very intelligent professors even who just have a bit of hard time communicating they come up with all these brilliant ideas but to communicate with somebody else you have to also be able to simulate their own mind yes empathy build well enough and understand model of their mind that you can say things that they will understand and thats quite difficult and thats why today its so frustrating if you have a computer that makes some cancer diagnosis and you ask it well why are you saying i should have this surgery and if it can only reply i was trained on five terabytes of data and this is my diagnosis boop boop beep beep it doesnt really instill a lot of confidence right so i think we have a lot of work to do on communication there so what kind of i think youre doing a little bit of work in explainable ai what do you think are the most promising avenues is it mostly about sort of the alexa problem of natural language processing of being able to actually use human interpretable methods of communication so being able to talk to a system and it talk back to you or is there some more fundamental problems to be solved i think its all of the above the natural language processing is obviously important but there are also more nerdy fundamental problems like if you take you play chess of course im russian i have to you speak russian yes i speak russian excellent i didnt know when did you learn russian i speak very bad russian im only an autodidact but i bought a book teach yourself russian read a lot but it was very difficult wow thats why i speak so bad how many languages do you know wow thats really impressive i dont know my wife has some calculation but my point was if you play chess have you looked at the alphazero games the actual games no check it out some of them are just mind blowing really beautiful and if you ask how did it do that you go talk to demis hassabis i know others from deepmind all theyll ultimately be able to give you is big tables of numbers matrices that define the neural network and you can stare at these tables of numbers till your face turn blue and youre not gonna understand much about why it made that move and even if you have natural language processing that can tell you in human language about oh five seven points two eight still not gonna really help so i think theres a whole spectrum of fun challenges that are involved in taking a computation that does intelligent things and transforming it into something equally good equally intelligent but thats more understandable and i think thats really valuable because i think as we put machines in charge of ever more infrastructure in our world the power grid the trading on the stock market weapon systems and so on its absolutely crucial that we can trust these ais to do all we want and trust really comes from understanding in a very fundamental way and thats why im working on this because i think the more if were gonna have some hope of ensuring that machines have adopted our goals and that theyre gonna retain them that kind of trust i think needs to be based on things you can actually understand preferably even improve theorems on even with a self driving car right if someone just tells you its been trained on tons of data and it never crashed its less reassuring than if someone actually has a proof maybe its a computer verified proof but still it says that under no circumstances is this car just gonna swerve into oncoming traffic and that kind of information helps to build trust and helps build the alignment of goals at least awareness that your goals your values are aligned and i think even in the very short term if you look at how you know today right this absolutely pathetic state of cybersecurity that we have where is it three billion yahoo accounts we cant pack almost every americans credit card and so on why is this happening its ultimately happening because we have software that nobody fully understood how it worked thats why the bugs hadnt been found right and i think ai can be used very effectively for offense for hacking but it can also be used for defense hopefully automating verifiability and creating systems that are built in different ways so you can actually prove things about them and its important so speaking of software that nobody understands how it works of course a bunch of people ask about your paper about your thoughts of why does deep and cheap learning work so well thats the paper but what are your thoughts on deep learning these kind of simplified models of our own brains have been able to do some successful perception work pattern recognition work and now with alphazero and so on do some clever things what are your thoughts about the promise limitations of this piece great i think there are a number of very important insights very important lessons we can always draw from these kinds of successes one of them is when you look at the human brain you see its very complicated 10th of 11 neurons and there are all these different kinds of neurons and yada yada and theres been this long debate about whether the fact that we have dozens of different kinds is actually necessary for intelligence',\n",
       " 'as part of mit course 6s099 on artificial general intelligence i got a chance to sit down with christoph koch who is one of the seminal figures in neurobiology neuroscience and generally in the study of consciousness he is the president the chief scientific officer of the allen institute for brain science in seattle from 1986 to 2013 he was a professor at caltech before that he was at mit he is extremely well cited over 100000 citations his research his writing his ideas have had big impact on the scientific community and the general public in the way we think about consciousness in the way we see ourselves as human beings hes the author of several books the quest for consciousness and neurobiological approach and a more recent book consciousness confessions of a romantic reductionist if you enjoy this conversation this course subscribe click the little bell icon to make sure you never miss a video and in the comments leave suggestions for any people youd like to see be part of the course or any ideas that you would like us to explore thanks very much and i hope you enjoy okay before we delve into the beautiful mysteries of consciousness lets zoom out a little bit and let me ask do you think theres intelligent life out there in the universe yes i do believe so we have no evidence of it but i think the probabilities are overwhelming in favor of it given a universe where we have 10 to the 11 galaxies and each galaxy has between 10 to the 11 10 to the 12 stars and we know most stars have one or more planets so how does that make you feel it still makes me feel special because i have experiences i feel the world i experience the world and independent of whether there are other creatures out there i still feel the world and i have access to this world in this very strange compelling way and thats the core of human existence now you said human do you think if those intelligent creatures are out there do you think they experience their world yes if they are evolved if they are a product of natural evolution as they would have to be they will also experience their own world the consciousness isnt just human youre right its much wider it may be spread across all of biology the only thing that we have special is we can talk about it of course not all people can talk about it babies and little children can talk about it patients who have a stroke in the left inferior frontal gyrus can talk about it but most normal adult people can talk about it and so we think that makes us special compared to lets say monkeys or dogs or cats or mice or all the other creatures that we share the planet with but all the evidence seems to suggest that they too experience the world and so its overwhelmingly likely that aliens would also experience their world of course differently because they have a different sensorium they have different sensors they have a very different environment but the fact that i would strongly suppose that they also have experiences they feel pain and pleasure and see in some sort of spectrum and hear and have all the other senses of course their language if they have one would be different so we might not be able to understand their poetry about the experiences that they have thats correct so in a talk in a video ive heard you mention siputzo a dachshund that you came up with that you grew up with it was part of your family when you were young first of all youre technically a midwestern boy you just – technically yes but after that you traveled around a bit hence a little bit of the accent you talked about siputzo the dachshund having these elements of humanness of consciousness that you discovered so i just wanted to ask can you look back in your childhood and remember when was the first time you realized you yourself sort of from a third person perspective are a conscious being this idea of stepping outside yourself and seeing theres something special going on here in my brain i cant really actually – its a good question im not sure i recall a discrete moment i mean you take it for granted because thats the only world you know the only world i know and you know is the world of seeing and hearing voices and touching and all the other things so its only much later at early – in my underguided days when i enrolled in physics and in philosophy that i really thought about it and thought well this is really fundamentally very very mysterious and theres nothing really in physics right now that explains this transition from the physics of the brain to feelings where do the feelings come in so you can look at the foundational equation of quantum mechanics general relativity you can look at the periodic table of the elements you can look at the endless atgc chat in our genes and nowhere is consciousness yet i wake up every morning to a world where i have experiences and so thats the heart of the ancient mind body problem how do experiences get into the world so what is consciousness experience this is any experience some people call it subjective feeling some people call it phenomenology some people call it qualia of the philosopher but they all denote the same thing it feels like something in the famous word of the philosopher thomas nagel it feels like something to be a bat or to be an american or to be angry or to be sad or to be in love or to have pain and that is what experience is any possible experience could be as mundane as just sitting in a chair could be as exalted as having a mystical moment in deep meditation those are just different forms of experiences experience so if you were to sit down with maybe the next skip a couple generations of ibm watson something that won jeopardy what is the gap i guess the question is between watson that might be much smarter than you than us than any human alive but may not have experience what is the gap well so thats a big big question thats occupied people for the last certainly last 50 years since we you know since the advent the birth of computers thats a question alan turing tried to answer and of course he did it in this indirect way by proposing a test an operational test but thats not really thats you know he tried to get at what does it mean for a person to think and then he had this test right you lock them away and then you have a communication with them and then you try to guess after a while whether that is a person or whether its a computer system theres no question that now or very soon you know alexa or siri or you know google now will pass this test right and you can game it but you know ultimately certainly in your generation there will be machines that will speak with complete poise that will remember everything you ever said theyll remember every email you ever had like samantha remember in the movie her yeah theres no question its going to happen but of course the key question is does it feel like anything to be samantha in the movie her or does it feel like anything to be watson and there one has to very very strongly think there are two different concepts here that we co mingle there is the concept of intelligence natural or artificial and there is a concept of consciousness of experience natural or artificial those are very very different things now historically we associate consciousness with intelligence why because we live in a world leaving aside computers of natural selection where were surrounded by creatures either our own kin that are less or more intelligent or we go across species some are more adapted to a particular environment others are less adapted whether its a whale or dog or you go talk about a paramecium or a little worm and we see the complexity of the nervous system goes from one cell to specialized cells to a worm that has three nets that has 30 percent of its cells are nerve cells to creature like us or like a blue whale that has 100 billion even more nerve cells and so based on behavioral evidence and based on the underlying neuroscience we believe that as these creatures become more complex they are better adapted to their particular ecological niche and they become more conscious partly because their brain grows and we believe consciousness unlike the ancient ancient people thought most almost every culture thought that consciousness with intelligence has to do with your heart and you still see that today you see honey i love you with all my heart but what you should actually say is no honey i love you with all my lateral hypothalamus and for valentines day you should give your sweetheart you know hypothalamus a piece of chocolate and not a heart shaped chocolate anyway so we still have this language but now we believe its a brain and so we see brains of different complexity and we think well they have different levels of consciousness theyre capable of different experiences but now we confront the world where we know where were beginning to engineer intelligence and its radical unclear whether the intelligence were engineering has anything to do with consciousness and whether it can experience anything because fundamentally whats the difference intelligence is about function intelligence no matter exactly how you define it sort of adaptation to new environments being able to learn and quickly understand you know the setup of this and whats going on and who are the actors and whats going to happen next thats all about function consciousness is not about function consciousness is about being its in some sense much fundamental you can see this in several cases you can see it for instance in the case of the clinic when youre dealing with patients who are lets say had a stroke or had were in traffic accident et cetera theyre pretty much immobile terri schiavo you may have heard historically she was a person here in the 90s in florida her heart stood still she was reanimated and then for the next 14 years she was whats called in a vegetative state so there are thousands of people in a vegetative state so theyre you know theyre you know theyre like this occasionally they open their eyes for two three four five six eight hours and then close their eyes they have sleep wake cycle occasionally they have behaviors they do like you know but theres no way that you can establish a lawful relationship between what you say or the doctor says or the mom says and what the patient does so there isnt any behavior yet in some of these people there is still experience you can design and build brain machine interfaces where you can see theres still experience something and of course these cases of locked in state theres this famous book called the diving bell and the butterfly where you had an editor a french editor he had a stroke in the brainstem unable to move except his vertical eyes eye movement he could just move his eyes up and down and he dictated an entire book and some people even lose this at the end all the evidence seems to suggest that theyre still in there in this case you have no behavior you have consciousness second case is tonight like all of us youre going to go to sleep close your eyes you go to sleep you will wake up inside your sleeping body and you will have conscious experiences they are different from everyday experience you might fly you might not be surprised that youre flying you might meet a long dead pet childhood dog and youre not surprised that youre meeting them but you have conscious experience of love of hate they can be very emotional your body during this state typically its rem state sends an active signal to your motor neurons to paralyze you its called atonia because if you dont have that like some patients what do you do you act out your dreams you get for example rem behavioral disorder which is bad juju to get okay third case is pure experience so i recently had this what some people call a mystical experience i went to singapore and went into a flotation tank yeah all right so this is a big tub filled with water thats body temperature and epsom salt you strip completely naked you lie inside of it you close the lid darkness complete darkness soundproof so very quickly you become bodiless because youre floating and youre naked you have no rings no watch no nothing you dont feel your body anymore theres no sound soundless theres no photon sightless timeless because after a while early on you actually hear your heart but then you sort of adapt to that and then sort of the passage of time ceases yeah and if you train yourself like in a meditation not to think early on you think a lot its a little bit spooky you feel somewhat uncomfortable or you think well im going to get bored and if you try to not to think actively you become mindless there you are bodiless timeless you know soundless sightless mindless but youre in a conscious experience youre not asleep yeah youre not asleep you are a being of pure youre a pure being there isnt any function you arent doing any computation youre not remembering youre not projecting youre not planning yet you are fully conscious youre fully conscious theres something going on there it could be just a side effect so what is the you mean epiphenomena so whats the select meaning why what is the function of you being able to lay in this sensory free deprivation tank and still have a conscious experience evolutionary evolutionary obviously we didnt evolve with flotation tanks in our environment i mean so biology is notoriously bad at asking why question telenormical question why do we have two eyes why dont we have four eyes like some teachers or three eyes or something well no theres probably there is a function to that but were not very good at answering those questions we can speculate endlessly where biology is very or science is very good about mechanistic question why is there a charge in the universe right we find a certain universe where there are positive and negative charges why why does quantum mechanics hold you know why doesnt some other theory hold quantum mechanics holding our universe is very unclear why so telenormical question why questions are difficult to answer theres some relationship between complexity brain processing power and consciousness but however in these cases in these three examples i gave one is an everyday experience at night the other one is trauma and third one is in principle you can everybody can have these sort of mystical experiences you have a dissociation of function from of intelligence from consciousness you caught me asking a why question let me ask a question thats not a why question youre giving a talk later today on the turing test for intelligence and consciousness drawing lines between the two so is there a scientific way to say theres consciousness present in this entity or not and to anticipate your answer cause you you will also theres a neurobiological answer so we can test the human brain but if you take a machine brain that you dont know tests for yet how would you even begin to approach a test if theres consciousness present in this thing okay thats a really good question so let me take it in two steps so as you point out for for for for humans lets just stick with humans theres now a test called the zap and zip is a procedure where you ping the brain using transcranial magnetic stimulation you look at the electrical reverberations essentially using eg and then you can measure the complexity of this brain response and you can do this in awake people in asleep normal people you can do it in awake people and then anesthetize them you can do it in patients and it it it has a hundred percent accuracy that in all those cases when youre clear the patient or the person is either conscious or unconscious the complexity is either high or low and then you can adopt these techniques to similar creatures like monkeys and dogs and and and mice that have very similar brains now of course you you point out that may not help you because we dont have a cortex you know and if i send a magnetic pulse into my iphone or my computer its probably going to break something so we dont have that so what we need ultimately we need a theory of consciousness we cant just rely on our intuition our intuition is well yeah if somebody talks theyre conscious however then there are all these patients children babies dont talk right but we believe that that the babies also have conscious experiences right and then there are all these patients i mentioned and they dont talk when you dream you cant talk because youre paralyzed so what we ultimately need we cant just rely on our intuition we need a theory of conscience that tells us what is it about a piece of matter what is it about a piece of highly excitable matter like the brain or like a computer that gives rise to conscious experience we all believe none of us believes anymore in the old story its a soul right that used to be the most common explanation that most people accept that instill a lot of people today believe well theres theres god endowed only us with a special thing that animals dont have rene descartes famously said a dog if you hit it with your carriage may yell may cry but it doesnt have this special thing it doesnt have the magic the magic soul it doesnt have res cogitans the soul now we believe that isnt the case anymore so what is the difference between brains and and these guys silicon and in particular once their behavior matches so if you have siri or alexa in 20 years from now that she can talk just as good as any possible human what grounds do you have to say shes not conscious in particular if she says its of course she will well of course im conscious you ask her how are you doing and shell say well you know they theyll generate some way to of course shell behave like a like a person now theres several differences one is so this relates to the problem the very hard why is consciousness a hard problem its because its subjective right only i have it for only i know i have direct experience of my own consciousness i dont have experience in your consciousness now i assume as a sort of a bayesian person who believes in probability theory and all of that you know i can do i can do an abduction to the to the best available facts i deduce your brain is very similar to mine if i put you in a scanner your brain is roughly going to behave the same way as i do if if if you know if i give you this muesli and ask you how does it taste you tell me things that you know that that i would also say more or less right so i infer based on all of that that youre conscious now with theory i cant do that so there i really need a theory that tells me what is it about about any system this or this that makes it conscious we have such a theory yes so the integrated information theory but let me first maybe as an introduction for people who are not familiar descartes can you you talk a lot about pan panpsychism can you describe what uh physicalism versus dualism this you you mentioned the soul what what is the history of that idea what is the idea of panpsychism or no the debate really uh out of which panpsychism can um emerge of of of um dualism versus uh physicalism or do you not see panpsychism as fitting into that no you can argue theres some okay so lets step back so panpsychism is a very ancient belief thats been around uh i mean plato and aristotle talks about it uh modern philosophers talk about it of course in buddhism the idea is very prevalent that i mean there are different versions of it one version says everything is ensouled everything rocks and stones and dogs and people and forest and iphones all of us all right all matter is ensouled thats sort of one version another version is that all biology all creatures small or large from a single cell to a giant sequoia tree feel like something this one i think is somewhat more realistic um so the different versions what do you mean by feel like something have have feelings have some kind of it feels like something it may well be possible that it feels like something to be a paramecium i think its pretty likely it feels like something to be a bee or a mouse or a dog sure so okay so so that you can see thats also so panpsychism is very broad and you can so some people for example bertrand russell tried to advocate this this idea its called rasselian monism that that panpsychism is really physics viewed from the inside so the idea is that physics is very good at describing relationship among objects like charges or like gravity right you know describe the relationship between curvature and mass distribution okay thats the relationship among things physics doesnt really describe the ultimate reality itself its just relationship among you know quarks or all these other stuff from like a third person observer yes yes yes and consciousness is what physics feels from the inside so my conscious experience its the way the physics of my brain particularly my cortex feels from the inside and so if you are paramecium you got to remember you say paramecium well thats a pretty dumb creature it is but it has already a billion different molecules probably you know 5000 different proteins assembled in a highly highly complex system that no single person no computer system so far on this planet has ever managed to accurately simulate its complexity vastly escapes us yes and it may well be that that little thing feels like a tiny bit now it doesnt have a voice in the head like me it doesnt have expectations you know it doesnt have all that complex things but it may well feel like something yeah so this is really interesting can we draw some lines and maybe try to understand the difference between life intelligence and consciousness how do you see all of those if you had to define what is a living thing what is a conscious thing and what is an intelligent thing do those intermix for you or are they totally separate okay so a thats a question that we dont have a full answer to a lot of the stuff were talking about today is full of mysteries and fascinating ones right for example you can go to aristotle whos probably the most important scientist and philosopher whos ever lived in certainly in western culture he had this idea its called hylomorphism its quite popular these days that there are different forms of soul the soul is really the form of something he says all biological creatures have a vegetative soul thats life principle today we think we understand something more than it is biochemistry and nonlinear thermodynamics then he said they have a sensitive soul only animals and humans have also a sensitive soul or a petitive soul they can see they can smell and they have drives they want to reproduce they want to eat et cetera and then only humans have what he called a rational soul okay and that idea then made it into christendom and then the rational soul is the one that lives forever he was very unclear he wasnt really i mean different readings of aristotle give different whether did he believe that rational soul was immortal or not i probably think he didnt but then of course that made it through plato into christianity and then this soul became immortal and then became the connection to god so you ask me essentially what is our modern conception of these three aristotle would have called them different forms life we think we know something about it at least life on this planet right although we dont understand how to originate it but its been difficult to rigorously pin down you see this in modern definitions of death in fact right now theres a conference ongoing again that tries to define legally and medically what is death it used to be very simple death is you stop breathing your heart stops beating youre dead totally uncontroversial if youre unsure you wait another 10 minutes if the patient doesnt breathe hes dead well now we have ventilators we have heart pacemakers so its much more difficult to define what death is typically death is defined as the end of life and life is defined before death okay so we dont have really very good definitions intelligence we dont have a rigorous definition we know something how to measure its called iq or g factors right and were beginning to build it in a narrow sense right like go alphago and watson and you know google cars and uber cars and all of that its still narrow ai and some people are thinking about artificial general intelligence but roughly as we said before its something to do with ability to learn and to adapt to new environments but that is as i said also its radical difference from experience and its very unclear if you build a machine that has agi its not at all a priori its not at all clear that this machine will have consciousness it may or may not so lets ask it the other way do you think if you were to try to build an artificial general intelligence system do you think figuring out how to build artificial consciousness would help you get to an agi so or put another way do you think intelligent requires consciousness in human it goes hand in hand in human or i think in biology consciousness intelligence goes hand in hand quay is illusion because the brain evolved to be highly complex complexity via the theory integrated information theory is sort of ultimately is what is closely tied to consciousness ultimately its causal power upon itself and so in evolved systems they go together in artificial system particularly in digital machines they do not go together and if you ask me point blank is alexa 200 in the year 2040 when she can easily pass every turing test is she conscious no even if she claims shes conscious in fact you could even do a more radical version of this thought experiment you can build a computer simulation of the human brain you know what henry markham in the blue brain project or the human brain project in switzerland is trying to do lets grant them all the success so in 10 years we have this perfect simulation of the human brain every neuron is simulated and it has a larynx and it has motor neurons it has a brocas area and of course theyll talk and theyll say hi i just woke up i feel great ok even that computer simulation that can in principle map onto your brain will not be conscious why because it simulates its a difference between the simulated and the real so it simulates the behavior associated with consciousness it might be it will if its done properly will have all the intelligence that that particular person theyre simulating has but simulating intelligence is not the same as having conscious experiences and i give you a really nice metaphor that engineers and physicists typically get i can write down einsteins field equation nine or ten equations that describe the link in general relativity between curvature and mass i can do that i can run this on my laptop to predict that the central the black hole at the center of our galaxy will be so massive that it will twist space time around it so no light can escape its a black hole but funny have you ever wondered why doesnt this computer simulation suck me in it simulates gravity but it doesnt have the causal power of gravity thats a huge difference so its a difference between the real and the simulator just like it doesnt get wet inside a computer when the computer runs code that simulates a weather storm and so in order to have to have artificial consciousness you have to give it the same causal power as the human brain you have to build so called a neuromorphic machine that has hardware that is very similar to the human brain not a digital clocked phenomenon computer so thats just to clarify though you think that consciousness is not required to create human level intelligence it seems to accompany in the human brain but for machine not thats correct so maybe just because this is agi lets dig in a little bit about what we mean by intelligence so one thing is the g factor these kind of iq tests of intelligence but i think if you maybe another way to say so in 2040 2050 people will have siri that is just really impressive do you think people will say siri is intelligent yes intelligence is this amorphous thing so to be intelligent it seems like you have to have some kind of connections with other human beings in a sense that you have to impress them with your intelligence and there feels you have to somehow operate in this world full of humans and for that there feels like there has to be something like consciousness so you think you can have just the worlds best natural nlp system natural language understanding generation and that will be that will get us happy and say you know what weve created an agi i dont know happy but yes i do believe we can get what we call high level functional intelligence particular sort of the g you know this fluid like intelligence that we cherish particularly at a place like mit right in machines i see a priori no reasons and i see a lot of reason to believe its going to happen very you know over the next 50 years or 30 years so for beneficial ai for creating an ai system thats so you mentioned ethics that is exceptionally intelligent but also does not do does you know aligns its values with our values as humanity do you think then it needs consciousness yes i think that that is a very good argument that if were concerned about ai and the threat of ai a la nick bostrom existentialist threat i think having an intelligence that has empathy right why do we find abusing a dog why do most of us find that abhorrent abusing any animal right why do we find that abhorrent because we have this thing called empathy which if you look at the greek really means feeling with i feel a path of empathy i have feeling with you i see somebody else suffer that isnt even my conspecific its not a person its not my wife or my kids its a dog but i feel naturally most of us not all of us most of us will feel emphatic and so it may well be in the long term interest of survival of homo sapiens sapiens that if we do build agi and it really becomes very powerful that it has an emphatic response and doesnt just exterminate humanity so as part of the full conscious experience to create a consciousness artificial or in our human consciousness do you think fear maybe were going to get into the earlier days with nietzsche and so on but do you think fear and suffering are essential to have consciousness do you have to have the full range of experience to have a system that has experience or can you have a system that only has very particular kinds of very positive experiences look you can have in principle people have done this in the rat where you implant an electrode in the hypothalamus the pleasure center of the rat and the rat stimulates itself above and beyond anything else it doesnt care about food or natural sex or drink anymore it just stimulates itself because its such a pleasurable feeling i guess its like an orgasm just you have all day long and so a priori i see no reason why you need a great variety now clearly to survive that wouldnt work right but if id engineered artificially i dont think you need a great variety of conscious experience you could have just pleasure or just fear it might be a terrible existence but i think thats possible at least on conceptual logical ground because any real creature whether artificially engineered you want to give it fear the fear of extinction that we all have and you also want to give it positive repetitive states states that you want the machine encouraged to do because they give the machine positive feedback so you mentioned panpsychism to jump back a little bit everything having some kind of mental property how do you go from there to something like human consciousness so everything having some elements of consciousness is there something special about human consciousness so its not everything like a spoon the form of panpsychism i think about doesnt ascribe consciousness to anything like this the spoon on my liver however the theory the integrated information theory does say that the system even one that looks from the outside relatively simple at least if they have this internal causal power it does feel like something the theory a priori doesnt say anything whats special about human biologically we know the one thing thats special about human is we speak and we have an overblown sense of our own importance we believe were exceptional and were just gods gift to the universe but behaviorally the main thing that we have we can plan over the long term we have language and that gives us an enormous amount of power and thats why we are the current dominant species on the planet so you mentioned god you grew up a devout roman catholic family so with consciousness youre sort of exploring some really deeply fundamental human things that religion also touches on where does religion fit into your thinking about consciousness youve grown throughout your life and changed your views on religion as far as i understand yeah i mean im now much closer to im not a roman catholic anymore i dont believe theres sort of this god the god i was educated to believe in sits somewhere in the fullness of time ill be united in some sort of everlasting bliss i just dont see any evidence for that look the world the night is large and full of wonders there are many things that i dont understand i think many things that we as a cult look we dont even understand more than 4 of all the universe dark matter dark energy we have no idea what it is maybe its lost socks what do i know so all i can tell you is its sort of my current religious or spiritual sentiment is much closer to some form of buddhism without the reincarnation unfortunately theres no evidence for it than reincarnation so can you describe the way buddhism sees the world a little bit well so they talk about so when i spent several meetings with the dalai lama and what always impressed me about him he really unlike for example lets say the pope or some cardinal he always emphasized minimizing the suffering of all creatures so they have this from the early beginning they look at suffering in all creatures not just in people but in everybody this universal and of course by degrees an animal in general is less capable of suffering than a well developed normally developed human and they think consciousness pervades in this universe and they have these techniques you can think of them like mindfulness etc and meditation that tries to access what they claim of this more fundamental aspect of reality im not sure its more fundamental i think about it theres the physical and then theres this inside view consciousness and those are the two aspects thats the only thing i have access to in my life and youve got to remember my conscious experience and your conscious experience comes prior to anything you know about physics comes prior to knowledge about the universe and atoms and super strings and molecules and all of that the only thing you directly are acquainted with is this world thats populated with things in images and sounds in your head and touches and all of that i actually have a question so it sounds like you kind of have a rich life you talk about rock climbing and it seems like you really love literature and consciousness is all about experiencing things so do you think that has helped your research on this topic yes particularly if you think about it the various states so for example when you do rock climbing or now i do rowing crew rowing and a bike every day you can get into this thing called the zone and ive always wanted about it particularly with respect to consciousness because its a strangely addictive state once people have it once they want to keep on going back to it and you wonder what is it so addicting about it and i think its the experience of almost close to pure experience because in this zone youre not conscious of inner voice anymore theres always inner voice nagging you you have to do this you have to do that you have to pay your taxes you have to fight with your ex and all of those things theyre always there but when youre in the zone all of that is gone and youre just in this wonderful state where youre fully out in the world youre climbing or youre rowing or biking or doing soccer or whatever youre doing and sort of consciousness is this youre all action or in this case of pure experience youre not action at all but in both cases you experience some aspect of conscious you touch some basic part of conscious existence that is so basic and so deeply satisfying you i think you touch the root of being thats really what youre touching there youre getting close to the root of being and thats very different from intelligence so what do you think about the simulation hypothesis simulation theory the idea that we all live in a computer simulation rapture for nerds rapture for nerds i think its as likely as the hypothesis had engaged hundreds of scholars for many centuries are we all just existing in the mind of god and this is just a modern version of it its equally plausible people love talking about these sort of things i know theyre book written about this simulation hypothesis if thats what people want to do thats fine it seems rather esoteric its never testable but its not useful for you to think of in those terms so maybe connecting to the questions of free will which youve talked about i vaguely remember you saying that the idea that theres no free will it makes you very uncomfortable so what do you think about free will from a physics perspective from a conscious perspective what does it all fit okay so from the physics perspective leaving aside quantum mechanics we believe we live in a fully deterministic world right but then comes of course quantum mechanics so now we know that certain things are in principle not predictable which as you said i prefer because the idea that the initial condition of the universe and then everything else were just acting out the initial condition of the universe that doesnt… its not a romantic notion certainly not now when it comes to consciousness i think we do have certain freedom we are much more constrained by physics of course and by our past and by our own conscious desires and what our parents told us and what our environment tells us we all know that right theres hundreds of experiments that show how we can be influenced but finally in the final analysis when you make a life – and im talking really about critical decision where you really think should i marry should i go to this school or that school should i take this job or that job should i cheat on my taxes or not these are things where you really deliberate and i think under those conditions you are as free as you can be when you bring your entire being your entire conscious being to that question and try to analyze it under all the various conditions then you make a decision you are as free as you can ever be that is i think what free will is its not a will thats totally free to do anything it wants thats not possible right so as jack mentioned you actually write a blog about books youve read amazing books from im russian from bulgakov neil gaiman carl sagan murakami so what is a book that early in your life transformed the way you saw the world something that changed your life nietzsche i guess did thats brooks r truster because he talks about some of these problems he was one of the first discoverer of the unconscious this is a little bit before freud when he was in the air he makes all these claims that people sort of under the guise or under the mass of charity actually are very noncharitable so he is sort of really the first discoverer of the great land of the unconscious and that really struck me and what do you think about the unconscious what do you think about freud what do you think about these ideas just like dark matter in the universe whats over there in that unconscious a lot i mean much more than we think this is what a lot of last 100 years of research has shown so i think he was a genius misguided towards the end but he started out as a neuroscientist he contributed he did the studies on the lamprey he contributed himself to the neuron hypothesis the idea that there are discrete units that we call nerve cells now and then he wrote about the unconscious and i think its true theres lots of stuff happening you feel this particular when youre in a relationship and it breaks asunder right and then you have this terrible you can have love and hate and lust and anger and all of its mixed in and when you try to analyze yourself why am i so upset its very very difficult to penetrate to those basements those caverns in your mind because the prying eyes of conscious doesnt have access to those but theyre there in the amygdala or lots of other places they make you upset or angry or sad or depressed and its very difficult to try to actually uncover the reason you can go to a shrink you can talk with your friend endlessly you construct finally a story why this happened why you love her or dont love her or whatever but you dont really know whether that actually happened because you simply dont have access to those parts of the brain and theyre very powerful do you think thats a feature or a bug of our brain the fact that we have this deep difficult to dive into subconscious i think its a feature because otherwise look we are like any other brain or nervous system or computer we are severely band limited if everything i do every emotion i feel every eye movements i make if all of that had to be under the control of consciousness i wouldnt be here what you do early on your brain you have to be conscious when you learn things like typing or like riding on a bike but then what you do you train up routes i think that involve basal ganglia and striatum you train up different parts of your brain and then once you do it automatically like typing you can show you do it much faster without even thinking about it because youve got these highly specialized what frans krik and i call zombie agents theyre taking care of that while your consciousness can sort of worry about the abstract sense of the text you want to write i think thats true for many many things but for the things like all the fights you had with an ex girlfriend things that you would think are not useful to still linger somewhere in the subconscious so that seems like a bug that it would stick to there you think it would be better if you can analyze it and then get it out of the system better to get it out of the system or just forget it ever happened that seems a very buggy kind of well yeah in general we dont have and thats probably functional we dont have an ability unless its extreme there are cases clinical dissociations right when people are heavily abused when they completely repress the memory but that doesnt happen in normal people we dont have an ability to remove traumatic memories and of course we suffer from that on the other hand probably if you had the ability to constantly wipe your memory youd probably do it to an extent that isnt useful to you so yeah its a good question to balance so on the books as jack mentioned correct me if im wrong but broadly speaking academia and the different scientific disciplines certainly in engineering reading literature seems to be a rare pursuit so im wrong on this but thats in my experience most people read much more technical text and do not sort of escape or seek truth in literature it seems like you do so what do you think is the value what do you think literature adds to the pursuit of scientific truth do you think its good its useful for everybody gives you access to a much wider array of human experiences how valuable do you think it is well if you want to understand human nature and nature in general then i think you have to better understand a wide variety of experiences not just sitting in a lab staring at a screen and having a face flashed onto you for a hundred milliseconds and pushing a button thats what i used to do thats what most psychologists do theres nothing wrong with that but you need to consider lots of other strange states and literature is a shortcut for this well yeah because literature thats what literature is all about all sorts of interesting experiences that people have the contingency of it the fact that women experience the world different black people experience the world different the one way to experience that is reading all these different literature and try to find out you see everything is so relative you read a book 300 years ago they thought about certain problems very very differently than us today we today like any culture think we know it all thats common to every culture every culture believes at its heyday they know it all and then you realize well theres other ways of viewing the universe and some of them may have lots of things in their favor so this is a question i wanted to ask about time scale or scale in general when you with iit or in general try to think about consciousness try to think about these ideas we kind of naturally think in human time scales and also entities that are sized close to humans do you think of things that are much larger and much smaller as containing consciousness and do you think of things that take you know eons to operate in their conscious cause effect thats a very good question so i think a lot about small creatures because experimentally you know a lot of people work on flies and bees right so most people just think they are automata theyre just bugs for heavens sake right but if you look at their behavior like bees they can recognize individual humans they have this very complicated way to communicate if youve ever been involved or you know your parents when they bought a house what sort of agonizing decision that is and bees have to do that once a year right when they swarm in the spring and then they have this very elaborate way they have free and scouts they go to the individual sites they come back they have this power this dance literally where they dance for several days they try to recruit other deets this very complicated decision rate when they finally once they make a decision the entire swarm the scouts warm up the entire swarm and then go to one location they dont go to 50 locations they go to one location that the scouts have agreed upon by themselves thats awesome if we look at the circuit complexity its 10 times more denser than anything we have in our brain now they only have a million neurons but the neurons are amazingly complex complex behavior very complicated circuitry so theres no question they experience something their life is very different theyre tiny they only live you know for well workers live maybe for two months so i think and iit tells you this in principle the substrate of consciousness is the substrate that maximizes the cause effect power over all possible spatial temporal grains so when i think about for example do you know the science fiction story the black cloud okay its a classic by fred hoyle the astronomer he has this cloud intervening between the earth and the sun and leading to some sort of to global cooling this is written in the 50s it turns out you can using the radio dish they communicate with actually an entity its actually an intelligent entity and they sort of they convince it to move away so here you have a radical different entity and in principle iit says well you can measure the integrated information in principle at least and yes if the maximum of that occurs at a time scale of months rather than in assets for a fraction of a second yes then they would experience life where each moment is a month rather than or microsecond right rather than a fraction of a second in the human case and so there may be forms of consciousness that we simply dont recognize for what they are because they are so radical different from anything you and i are used to again thats why its good to read or to watch science fiction movies well to think about this do you know stanislav lem this polish science fiction writer he wrote solaris and was turned into a hollywood movie yes his best novel is in the 60s a very engineer hes an engineer in background his most interesting novel is called the victorious where human civilization they have this mission to this planet and everything is destroyed and they discover machines humans got killed and then these machines took over and there was this machine evolution darwinian evolution he talks about this very vividly and finally the dominant machine intelligence organism that survived were gigantic clouds of little hexagonal universal cellular automata this was written in the 60s so typically theyre all lying on the ground individual by themselves but in times of crisis they can communicate they assemble into gigantic nets into clouds of trillions of these particles and then they become hyper intelligent and they can beat anything that humans can throw at it its very beautiful and compelling where you have an intelligence where finally the humans leave the planet theyre simply unable to understand and comprehend this creature they can say well either we can nuke the entire planet and destroy it or we just have to leave because fundamentally its an alien its so alien from us and our ideas that we cannot communicate with them yeah actually in conversation so youre talking to us steven wolf from brought up is that there could be ideas that you already have these artificial general intelligence like super smart or maybe conscious beings in the cellular automata we just dont know how to talk to them so its the language of communication but you dont know what to do with it so thats one sort of view is consciousness is only something you can measure so its not conscious if you cant measure it so youre making an ontological and an epistemic statement one is its just like seeing the multiverses that might be true but i cant communicate with them i cant have any knowledge of them thats an epistemic argument right so those are two different things so it may well be possible look in another case thats happening right now people are building these mini organoids do you know what this is so you can take stem cells from under your arm put it in a dish add four transcription factors and then you can induce them to grow into large well large theyre a few millimeters theyre like a half a million neurons that look like nerve cells in a dish called mini organoids at harvard at stanford everywhere theyre building them it may well be possible that theyre beginning to feel like something but we cant really communicate with them right now so people are beginning to think about the ethics of this so yes he may be perfectly right but its one question are they conscious or not its a totally separate question how would i know those are two different things if you could give advice to a young researcher sort of dreaming of understanding or creating human level intelligence or consciousness what would you say just follow your dreams read widely no i mean i suppose with discipline what is the pursuit that they should take on is it neuroscience is it computational cognitive science is it philosophy is it computer science or robotics no in a sense that okay so the only known system that have high level of intelligence is homo sapiens so if you wanted to build it its probably good to continue to study closely what humans do so cognitive neuroscience you know somewhere between cognitive neuroscience on the one hand and some philosophy of mind and then ai ai computer science you can look at all the original ideas in your network they all came from neuroscience right reinforce whether its snarky minsky building is snarky or whether its you know the early hubel and wiesel experiments at harvard that then gave rise to networks and then multi layer networks so it may well be possible in fact some people argue that to make the next big step in ai once we realize the limits of deep convolutional networks they can do certain things but they cant really understand they dont they cant really i cant really show them one image i can show you a single image of somebody a pickpocket who steals a wallet from a purse you immediately know thats a pickpocket now computer system would just say well its a man its a woman its a purse right unless you train this machine on showing it a hundred thousand pickpockets right so it doesnt have this easy understanding that you have right so some people make the argument in order to go to the next step or you really want to build machines that understand in a way you and i we have to go to psychology we need to understand how we do it and how our brains enable us to do it and so therefore being on the cusp its also so exciting to try to understand better our nature and then to build to take some of those inside and build them so i think the most exciting thing is somewhere in the interface between cognitive science neuroscience ai computer science and philosophy of mind beautiful yeah id say if there is from the machine learning from our from the computer science computer vision perspective many of the researchers kind of ignore the way the human brain works or even psychology or literature or studying the brain i would hope josh tenenbaum talks about bringing that in more and more and thats yeah so youve worked on some amazing stuff throughout your life whats the thing that youre really excited about whats the mystery that you would love to uncover in the near term beyond beyond all the mysteries that youre already surrounded by well so theres a structure called the claustrum this is a structure its underneath our cortex its yay big you have one on the left on the right underneath this underneath the insula its very thin its like one millimeter its embedded in in wiring in white matter so its very difficult to image and it has it has connection to every cortical region and francis crick the last paper he ever wrote he dictated corrections the day he died in hospital on this paper you know we hypothesize well because it has this unique anatomy it gets input from every cortical area and projects back to every every cortical area that the function of this structure is similar its just a metaphor to the role of a conductor in a symphony orchestra you have all the different cortical players you have some that do motion some that do theory of mind some that infer social interaction and color and hearing and all the different modules in cortex but of course what consciousness is consciousness puts it all together into one package right the binding problem all of that and this is really the function because it has relatively few neurons compared to cortex but it talks it receives input from all of them and it projects back to all of them and so were testing that right now weve got this beautiful neuronal reconstruction in the mouse called crown of thorns crown of thorns neurons that are in the claustrum that have the most widespread connection of any neuron ive ever seen theyre very you have individual neurons that sit in the claustrum tiny but then they have this single neuron they have this huge axonal tree that cover both ipsy and contralateral cortex and trying to turn using you know fancy tools like optogenetics trying to turn those neurons on or off and study it what happens in the in the mouse so this thing is perhaps where the parts become the whole perhaps its one of the structures its a very good way of putting it where the individual parts turn into the whole of the whole of the conscious experience well with that thank you very much for being here today thank you very much thank you very much all right thank you very much',\n",
       " 'youve studied the human mind cognition language vision evolution psychology from child to adult from the level of individual to the level of our entire civilization so i feel like i can start with a simple multiple choice question what is the meaning of life is it a to attain knowledge as plato said b to attain power as nietzsche said c to escape death as ernest becker said d to propagate our genes as darwin and others have said e there is no meaning as the nihilists have said f knowing the meaning of life is beyond our cognitive capabilities as stephen pinker said based on my interpretation 20 years ago and g none of the above id say a comes closest but i would amend that to c to attaining not only knowledge but fulfillment more generally that is life health stimulation access to the living cultural and social world now this is our meaning of life its not the meaning of life if you were to ask our genes their meaning is to propagate copies of themselves but that is distinct from the meaning that the brain that they lead to sets for itself so to you knowledge is a small subset or a large subset its a large subset but its not the entirety of human striving because we also want to interact with people we want to experience beauty we want to experience the richness of the natural world but understanding what makes the universe tick is way up there for some of us more than others certainly for me thats one of the top five so is that a fundamental aspect are you just describing your own preference or is this a fundamental aspect of human nature is to seek knowledge in your latest book you talk about the power the usefulness of rationality and reason and so on is that a fundamental nature of human beings or is it something we should just strive for both were capable of striving for it because it is one of the things that make us what we are homo sapiens wise men we are unusual among animals in the degree to which we acquire knowledge and use it to survive we make tools we strike agreements via language we extract poisons we predict the behavior of animals we try to get at the workings of plants and when i say we i dont just mean we in the modern west but we as a species everywhere which is how weve managed to occupy every niche on the planet how weve managed to drive other animals to extinction and the refinement of reason in pursuit of human wellbeing of health happiness social richness cultural richness is our main challenge in the present that is using our intellect using our knowledge to figure out how the world works how we work in order to make discoveries and strike agreements that make us all better off in the long run right and you do that almost undeniably and in a data driven way in your recent book but id like to focus on the artificial intelligence aspect of things and not just artificial intelligence but natural intelligence too so 20 years ago in a book youve written on how the mind works you conjecture again am i right to interpret things you can correct me if im wrong but you conjecture that human thought in the brain may be a result of a massive network of highly interconnected neurons so from this interconnectivity emerges thought compared to artificial neural networks which we use for machine learning today is there something fundamentally more complex mysterious even magical about the biological neural networks versus the ones weve been starting to use over the past 60 years and have become to success in the past 10 there is something a little bit mysterious about the human neural networks which is that each one of us who is a neural network knows that we ourselves are conscious conscious not in the sense of registering our surroundings or even registering our internal state but in having subjective first person present tense experience that is when i see red its not just different from green but theres a redness to it that i feel whether an artificial system would experience that or not i dont know and i dont think i can know thats why its mysterious if we had a perfectly lifelike robot that was behaviorally indistinguishable from a human would we attribute consciousness to it or ought we to attribute consciousness to it and thats something that its very hard to know but putting that aside putting aside that largely philosophical question the question is is there some difference between the human neural network and the ones that were building in artificial intelligence will mean that were on the current trajectory not going to reach the point where weve got a lifelike robot indistinguishable from a human because the way their so called neural networks are organized are different from the way ours are organized i think theres overlap but i think there are some big differences that current neural networks current so called deep learning systems are in reality not all that deep that is they are very good at extracting high order statistical regularities but most of the systems dont have a semantic level a level of actual understanding of who did what to whom why where how things work what causes what else do you think that kind of thing can emerge as it does so artificial neural networks are much smaller the number of connections and so on than the current human biological networks but do you think sort of to go to consciousness or to go to this higher level semantic reasoning about things do you think that can emerge with just a larger network with a more richly weirdly interconnected network separate it in consciousness because consciousness is even a matter of complexity a really weird one yeah you could sensibly ask the question of whether shrimp are conscious for example theyre not terribly complex but maybe they feel pain so lets just put that part of it aside but i think sheer size of a neural network is not enough to give it structure and knowledge but if its suitably engineered then why not that is were neural networks natural selection did a kind of equivalent of engineering of our brains so i dont think theres anything mysterious in the sense that no system made out of silicon could ever do what a human brain can do i think its possible in principle whether itll ever happen depends not only on how clever we are in engineering these systems but whether we even want to whether thats even a sensible goal that is you can ask the question is there any locomotion system that is as good as a human well we kind of want to do better than a human ultimately in terms of legged locomotion theres no reason that humans should be our benchmark theyre tools that might be better in some ways it may be that we cant duplicate a natural system because at some point its so much cheaper to use a natural system that were not going to invest more brainpower and resources so for example we dont really have an exact substitute for wood we still build houses out of wood we still build furniture out of wood we like the look we like the feel it has certain properties that synthetics dont its not that theres anything magical or mysterious about wood its just that the extra steps of duplicating everything about wood is something we just havent bothered because we have wood likewise say cotton im wearing cotton clothing now it feels much better than polyester its not that cotton has something magic in it its not that we couldnt ever synthesize something exactly like cotton but at some point its just not worth it weve got cotton likewise in the case of human intelligence the goal of making an artificial system that is exactly like the human brain is a goal that we probably know is going to pursue to the bitter end i suspect because if you want tools that do things better than humans youre not going to care whether it does something like humans so for example diagnosing cancer or predicting the weather why set humans as your benchmark but in general i suspect you also believe that even if the human should not be a benchmark and we dont want to imitate humans in their system theres a lot to be learned about how to create an artificial intelligence system by studying the human yeah i think thats right in the same way that to build flying machines we want to understand the laws of aerodynamics including birds but not mimic the birds but theyre the same laws you have a view on ai artificial intelligence and safety that from my perspective is refreshingly rational or perhaps more importantly has elements of positivity to it which i think can be inspiring and empowering as opposed to paralyzing for many people including ai researchers the eventual existential threat of ai is obvious not only possible but obvious and for many others including ai researchers the threat is not obvious so elon musk is famously in the highly concerned about ai camp saying things like ai is far more dangerous than nuclear weapons and that ai will likely destroy human civilization human civilization so in february he said that if elon was really serious about ai the threat of ai he would stop building self driving cars that hes doing very successfully as part of tesla then he said wow if even pinker doesnt understand the difference between narrow ai like a car and general ai when the latter literally has a million times more compute power and an open ended utility function humanity is in deep trouble so first what did you mean by the statement about elon musk should stop building self driving cars if hes deeply concerned not the last time that elon musk has fired off an intemperate tweet well we live in a world where twitter has power yes yeah i think there are two kinds of existential threat that have been discussed in connection with artificial intelligence and i think that theyre both incoherent one of them is a vague fear of ai takeover that just as we subjugated animals and less technologically advanced peoples so if we build something thats more advanced than us it will inevitably turn us into pets or slaves or domesticated animal equivalents i think this confuses intelligence with a will to power that it so happens that in the intelligence system we are most familiar with namely homo sapiens we are products of natural selection which is a competitive process and so bundled together with our problem solving capacity are a number of nasty traits like dominance and exploitation and maximization of power and glory and resources and influence theres no reason to think that sheer problem solving capability will set that as one of its goals its goals will be whatever we set its goals as and as long as someone isnt building a megalomaniacal artificial intelligence then theres no reason to think that it would naturally evolve in that direction now you might say well what if we gave it the goal of maximizing its own power source thats a pretty stupid goal to give an autonomous system you dont give it that goal i mean thats just self evidently idiotic so if you look at the history of the world theres been a lot of opportunities where engineers could instill in a system destructive power and they choose not to because thats the natural process of engineering well except for weapons i mean if youre building a weapon its goal is to destroy people and so i think there are good reasons to not build certain kinds of weapons i think building nuclear weapons was a massive mistake you do so maybe pause on that because that is one of the serious threats do you think that it was a mistake in a sense that it should have been stopped early on or do you think its just an unfortunate event of invention that this was invented do you think its possible to stop i guess is the question its hard to rewind the clock because of course it was invented in the context of world war ii and the fear that the nazis might develop one first then once it was initiated for that reason it was hard to turn off especially since winning the war against the japanese and the nazis was such an overwhelming goal of every responsible person that theres just nothing that people wouldnt have done then to ensure victory its quite possible if world war ii hadnt happened that nuclear weapons wouldnt have been invented we cant know but i dont think it was by any means a necessity any more than some of the other weapon systems that were envisioned but never implemented like planes that would disperse poison gas over cities like crop dusters or systems to try to create earthquakes and tsunamis in enemy countries to weaponize the weather weaponize solar flares all kinds of crazy schemes that we thought the better of i think analogies between nuclear weapons and artificial intelligence are fundamentally misguided because the whole point of nuclear weapons is to destroy things the point of artificial intelligence is not to destroy things so the analogy is misleading so theres two artificial intelligence you mentioned the first one i guess is highly intelligent or power hungry yeah its a system that we design ourselves where we give it the goals goals are external to the means to attain the goals if we dont design an artificially intelligent system to maximize dominance then it wont maximize dominance its just that were so familiar with homo sapiens where these two traits come bundled together particularly in men that we are apt to confuse high intelligence with a will to power but thats just an error the other fear is that will be collateral damage that will give artificial intelligence a goal like make paper clips and it will pursue that goal so brilliantly that before we can stop it it turns us into paper clips well give it the goal of curing cancer and it will turn us into guinea pigs for lethal experiments or give it the goal of world peace and its conception of world peace is no people therefore no fighting and so it will kill us all now i think these are utterly fanciful in fact i think theyre actually self defeating they first of all assume that were going to be so brilliant that we can design an artificial intelligence that can cure cancer but so stupid that we dont specify what we mean by curing cancer in enough detail that it wont kill us in the process and it assumes that the system will be so smart that it can cure cancer but so idiotic that it cant figure out that what we mean by curing cancer is not killing everyone i think that the collateral damage scenario the value alignment problem is also based on a misconception so one of the challenges of course we dont know how to build either system currently or are we even close to knowing of course those things can change overnight but at this time theorizing about it is very challenging in either direction so thats probably at the core of the problem is without that ability to reason about the real engineering things here at hand is your imagination runs away with things exactly but let me sort of ask what do you think was the motivation the thought process of elon musk i build autonomous vehicles i study autonomous vehicles i study tesla autopilot i think it is one of the greatest currently large scale application of artificial intelligence in the world it has potentially a very positive impact on society so how does a person whos creating this very good quote unquote narrow ai system also seem to be so concerned about this other general ai what do you think is the motivation there what do you think is the thing well you probably have to ask him but there and he is notoriously flamboyant impulsive to the as we have just seen to the detriment of his own goals of the health of the company so i dont know whats going on in his mind you probably have to ask him but i dont think the and i dont think the distinction between special purpose ai and so called general ai is relevant that in the same way that special purpose ai is not going to do anything conceivable in order to attain a goal all engineering systems are designed to trade off across multiple goals when we build cars in the first place we didnt forget to install brakes because the goal of a car is to go fast it occurred to people yes you want it to go fast but not always so you would build in brakes too likewise if a car is going to be autonomous and program it to take the shortest route to the airport its not going to take the diagonal and mow down people and trees and fences because thats the shortest route thats not what we mean by the shortest route when we program it and thats just what an intelligence system is by definition it takes into account multiple constraints the same is true in fact even more true of so called general intelligence that is if its genuinely intelligent its not going to pursue some goal singlemindedly omitting every other consideration and collateral effect thats not artificial and general intelligence thats artificial stupidity i agree with you by the way on the promise of autonomous vehicles for improving human welfare i think its spectacular and im surprised at how little press coverage notes that in the united states alone something like 40000 people die every year on the highways vastly more than are killed by terrorists and we spent a trillion dollars on a war to combat deaths by terrorism about half a dozen a year whereas year in year out 40000 people are massacred on the highways which could be brought down to very close to zero so im with you on the humanitarian benefit let me just mention that as a person whos building these cars it is a little bit offensive to me to say that engineers would be clueless enough not to engineer safety into systems i often stay up at night thinking about those 40000 people that are dying and everything i tried to engineer is to save those peoples lives so every new invention that im super excited about in all the deep learning literature and cvpr conferences and nips everything im super excited about is all grounded in making it safe and help people so i just dont see how that trajectory can all of a sudden slip into a situation where intelligence will be highly negative you and i certainly agree on that and i think thats only the beginning of the potential humanitarian benefits of artificial intelligence theres been enormous attention to what are we going to do with the people whose jobs are made obsolete by artificial intelligence but very little attention given to the fact that the jobs that are going to be made obsolete are horrible jobs the fact that people arent going to be picking crops and making beds and driving trucks and mining coal these are soul deadening jobs and we have a whole literature sympathizing with the people stuck in these menial mind deadening dangerous jobs if we can eliminate them this is a fantastic boon to humanity now granted you solve one problem and theres another one namely how do we get these people a decent income but if were smart enough to invent machines that can make beds and put away dishes and handle hospital patients i think were smart enough to figure out how to redistribute income to apportion some of the vast economic savings to the human beings who will no longer be needed to make beds okay sam harris says that its obvious that eventually ai will be an existential risk hes one of the people who says its obvious we dont know when the claim goes but eventually its obvious and because we dont know when we should worry about it now this is a very interesting argument in my eyes so how do we think about timescale how do we think about existential threats when we dont really we know so little about the threat unlike nuclear weapons perhaps about this particular threat that it could happen tomorrow right so but very likely it wont very likely itd be a hundred years away so how do we ignore it how do we talk about it do we worry about it how do we think about those what is it a threat that we can imagine its within the limits of our imagination but not within our limits of understanding to accurately predict it but what is the it that were afraid of sorry ai being the existential threat ai how like enslaving us or turning us into paperclips i think the most compelling from the sam harris perspective would be the paperclip situation yeah i mean i just think its totally fanciful i mean that is dont build a system dont give a dont first of all the code of engineering is you dont implement a system with massive control before testing it now perhaps the culture of engineering will radically change then i would worry but i dont see any signs that engineers will suddenly do idiotic things like put a electric power plant in control of a system that they havent tested first or all of these scenarios not only imagine almost a magically powered intelligence including things like cure cancer which is probably an incoherent goal because theres so many different kinds of cancer or bring about world peace i mean how do you even specify that as a goal but the scenarios also imagine some degree of control of every molecule in the universe which not only is itself unlikely but we would not start to connect these systems to infrastructure without testing as we would any kind of engineering system now maybe some engineers will be irresponsible and we need legal and regulatory and legal responsibility implemented so that engineers dont do things that are stupid by their own standards but the ive never seen enough of a plausible scenario of existential threat to devote large amounts of brain power to to forestall it so you believe in the sort of the power on mass of the engineering of reason as you argue in your latest book of reason and science to sort of be the very thing that guides the development of new technology so its safe and also keeps us safe you know granted the same culture of safety that currently is part of the engineering mindset for airplanes for example so yeah i dont think that that should be thrown out the window and that untested all powerful systems should be suddenly implemented but theres no reason to think they are and in fact if you look at the progress of artificial intelligence its been you know its been impressive especially in the last 10 years or so but the idea that suddenly therell be a step function that all of a sudden before we know it it will be all powerful that therell be some kind of recursive self improvement some kind of fume is also fanciful we certainly by the technology that we that were now impresses us such as deep learning where you train something on hundreds of thousands or millions of examples theyre not hundreds of thousands of problems of which curing cancer is a typical example and so the kind of techniques that have allowed ai to increase in the last five years are not the kind that are going to lead to this fantasy of exponential sudden self improvement i think its kind of a magical thinking its not based on our understanding of how ai actually works now give me a chance here so you said fanciful magical thinking in his ted talk sam harris says that thinking about ai killing all human civilization is somehow fun intellectually now i have to say as a scientist engineer i dont find it fun but when im having beer with my non ai friends there is indeed something fun and appealing about it like talking about an episode of black mirror considering if a large meteor is headed towards earth we were just told a large meteor is headed towards earth something like this and can you relate to this sense of fun and do you understand the psychology of it yes good question i personally dont find it fun i find it kind of actually a waste of time because there are genuine threats that we ought to be thinking about like pandemics like cyber security vulnerabilities like the possibility of nuclear war and certainly climate change you know this is enough to fill many conversations and i think sam did put his finger on something namely that there is a community sometimes called the rationality community that delights in using its brainpower to come up with scenarios that would not occur to mere mortals to less cerebral people so there is a kind of intellectual thrill in finding new things to worry about that no one has worried about yet i actually think though that its not only is it a kind of fun that doesnt give me particular pleasure but i think there can be a pernicious side to it namely that you overcome people with such dread such fatalism that there are so many ways to die to annihilate our civilization that we may as well enjoy life while we can theres nothing we can do about it if climate change doesnt do us in then runaway robots will so lets enjoy ourselves now weve got to prioritize we have to look at threats that are close to certainty such as climate change and distinguish those from ones that are merely imaginable but with infinitesimal probabilities and we have to take into account peoples worry budget you cant worry about everything and if you sow dread and fear and terror and fatalism it can lead to a kind of numbness well these problems are overwhelming and the engineers are just going to kill us all so lets either destroy the entire infrastructure of science technology or lets just enjoy life while we can so theres a certain line of worry which im worried about a lot of things in engineering theres a certain line of worry when you cross youre allowed to cross that it becomes paralyzing fear as opposed to productive fear and thats kind of what youre highlighting exactly right and weve seen some we know that human effort is not well calibrated against risk in that because a basic tenet of cognitive psychology is that perception of risk and hence perception of fear is driven by imaginability not by data and so we misallocate vast amounts of resources to avoiding terrorism which kills on average about six americans a year with one exception of 9 11 we invade countries we invent entire new departments of government with massive massive expenditure of resources and lives to defend ourselves against a trivial risk whereas guaranteed risks one of them you mentioned traffic fatalities and even risks that are not here but are plausible enough to worry about like pandemics like nuclear war receive far too little attention in presidential debates theres no discussion of how to minimize the risk of nuclear war lots of discussion of terrorism for example and so i think its essential to calibrate our budget of fear worry concern planning to the actual probability of harm yep so let me ask this question so speaking of imaginability you said its important to think about reason and one of my favorite people who likes to dip into the outskirts of reason through fascinating exploration of his imagination is joe rogan oh yes so who has through reason used to believe a lot of conspiracies and through reason has stripped away a lot of his beliefs in that way so its fascinating actually to watch him through rationality kind of throw away the ideas of bigfoot and 9 11 im not sure exactly kim trails i dont know what he believes in yes okay but he no longer believed in no thats right no hes become a real force for good yep so you were on the joe rogan podcast in february and had a fascinating conversation but as far as i remember didnt talk much about artificial intelligence i will be on his podcast in a couple of weeks joe is very much concerned about existential threat of ai im not sure if youre this is why i was hoping that you would get into that topic and in this way he represents quite a lot of people who look at the topic of ai from 10000 foot level so as an exercise of communication you said its important to be rational and reason about these things let me ask if you were to coach me as an ai researcher about how to speak to joe and the general public about ai what would you advise well the short answer would be to read the sections that i wrote in enlightenment now about ai but a longer reason would be i think to emphasize and i think youre very well positioned as an engineer to remind people about the culture of engineering that it really is safety oriented that another discussion in enlightenment now i plot rates of accidental death from various causes plane crashes car crashes occupational accidents even death by lightning strikes and they all plummet because the culture of engineering is how do you squeeze out the lethal risks death by fire death by drowning death by asphyxiation all of them drastically declined because of advances in engineering that i got to say i did not appreciate until i saw those graphs and it is because exactly people like you who stay up at night thinking oh my god is what im inventing likely to hurt people and to deploy ingenuity to prevent that from happening now im not an engineer although i spent 22 years at mit so i know something about the culture of engineering my understanding is that this is the way you think if youre an engineer and its essential that that culture not be suddenly switched off when it comes to artificial intelligence so i mean that could be a problem but is there any reason to think it would be switched off i dont think so and one theres not enough engineers speaking up for this way for the excitement for the positive view of human nature what youre trying to create is positivity like everything we try to invent is trying to do good for the world but let me ask you about the psychology of negativity it seems just objectively not considering the topic it seems that being negative about the future makes you sound smarter than being positive about the future irregardless of topic am i correct in this observation and if so why do you think that is yeah i think there is that phenomenon that as tom lehrer the satirist said always predict the worst and youll be hailed as a prophet it may be part of our overall negativity bias we are as a species more attuned to the negative than the positive we dread losses more than we enjoy gains and that might open up a space for prophets to remind us of harms and risks and losses that we may have overlooked so i think there is that asymmetry so youve written some of my favorite books all over the place so starting from enlightenment now to the better ages of our nature blank slate how the mind works the one about language language instinct bill gates big fan too said of your most recent book that its my new favorite book of all time so for you as an author what was a book early on in your life that had a profound impact on the way you saw the world certainly this book enlightenment now was influenced by david deutschs the beginning of infinity a rather deep reflection on knowledge and the power of knowledge to improve the human condition and with bits of wisdom such as that problems are inevitable but problems are solvable given the right knowledge and that solutions create new problems that have to be solved in their turn thats i think a kind of wisdom about the human condition that influenced the writing of this book there are some books that are excellent but obscure some of which i have on a page on my website i read a book called the history of force self published by a political scientist named james payne on the historical decline of violence and that was one of the inspirations for the better angels of our nature what about early on if you look back when you were maybe a teenager i loved a book called one two three infinity when i was a young adult i read that book by george gamow the physicist which had very accessible and humorous explanations of relativity of number theory of dimensionality high multiple dimensional spaces in a way that i think is still delightful 70 years after it was published i like the time life science series these are books that would arrive every month that my mother subscribed to each one on a different topic one would be on electricity one would be on forests one would be on evolution and then one was on the mind i was just intrigued that there could be a science of mind and that book i would cite as an influence as well then later on thats when you fell in love with the idea of studying the mind was that the thing that grabbed you it was one of the things i would say i read as a college student the book reflections on language by noam chomsky i spent most of his career here at mit richard dawkins two books the blind watchmaker and the selfish gene were enormously influential mainly for the content but also for the writing style the ability to explain abstract concepts in lively prose stephen jay goulds first collection ever since darwin also an excellent example of lively writing george miller a psychologist that most psychologists are familiar with came up with the idea that human memory has a capacity of seven plus or minus two chunks thats probably his biggest claim to fame but he wrote a couple of books on language and communication that i read as an undergraduate again beautifully written and intellectually deep wonderful stephen thank you so much for taking the time today my pleasure thanks a lot lex',\n",
       " 'what difference between biological neural networks and artificial neural networks is most mysterious captivating and profound for you first of all theres so much we dont know about biological neural networks and thats very mysterious and captivating because maybe it holds the key to improving artificial neural networks one of the things i studied recently is something that we dont know how biological neural networks do but would be really useful for artificial ones is the ability to do credit assignment through very long time spans there are things that we can in principle do with artificial neural nets but its not very convenient and its not biologically plausible and this mismatch i think this kind of mismatch may be an interesting thing to study to a understand better how brains might do these things because we dont have good corresponding theories with artificial neural nets and b maybe provide new ideas that we could explore about things that brain do differently and that we could incorporate in artificial neural nets so lets break credit assignment up a little bit yes so what its a beautifully technical term but it could incorporate so many things so is it more on the rnn memory side that thinking like that or is it something about knowledge building up common sense knowledge over time or is it more in the reinforcement learning sense that youre picking up rewards over time for a particular to achieve a certain kind of goal so i was thinking more about the first two meanings whereby we store all kinds of memories episodic memories in our brain which we can access later in order to help us both infer causes of things that we are observing now and assign credit to decisions or interpretations we came up with a while ago when those memories were stored and then we can change the way we would have reacted or interpreted things in the past and now thats credit assignment used for learning so in which way do you think artificial neural networks the current lstm the current architectures are not able to capture the presumably youre thinking of very long term yes so current the current nets are doing a fairly good jobs for sequences with dozens or say hundreds of time steps and then it gets harder and harder and depending on what you have to remember and so on as you consider longer durations whereas humans seem to be able to do credit assignment through essentially arbitrary times like i could remember something i did last year and then now because i see some new evidence im going to change my mind about the way i was thinking last year and hopefully not do the same mistake again i think a big part of that is probably forgetting youre only remembering the really important things its very efficient forgetting yes so theres a selection of what we remember and i think there are really cool connection to higher level cognition here regarding consciousness deciding and emotions so deciding what comes to consciousness and what gets stored in memory which are not trivial either so youve been at the forefront there all along showing some of the amazing things that neural networks deep neural networks can do in the field of artificial intelligence is just broadly in all kinds of applications but we can talk about that forever but what in your view because were thinking towards the future is the weakest aspect of the way deep neural networks represent the world what is that what is in your view is missing so current state of the art neural nets trained on large quantities of images or texts have some level of understanding of you know what explains those data sets but its very basic its its very low level and its not nearly as robust and abstract and general as our understanding okay so that doesnt tell us how to fix things but i think it encourages us to think about how we can maybe train our neural nets differently so that they would focus for example on causal explanation something that we dont do currently with neural net training also one thing ill talk about in my talk this afternoon is the fact that instead of learning separately from images and videos on one hand and from texts on the other hand we need to do a better job of jointly learning about language and about the world to which it refers so that you know both sides can help each other we need to have good world models in our neural nets for them to really understand sentences which talk about whats going on in the world and i think we need language input to help provide clues about what high level concepts like semantic concepts should be represented at the top levels of our neural nets in fact there is evidence that the purely unsupervised learning of representations doesnt give rise to high level representations that are as powerful as the ones were getting from supervised learning and so the clues were getting just with the labels not even sentences is already very very high level and i think thats a very important thing to keep in mind its already very powerful do you think thats an architecture challenge or is it a data set challenge neither im tempted to just end it there can you elaborate slightly of course data sets and architectures are something you want to always play with but i think the crucial thing is more the training objectives the training frameworks for example going from passive observation of data to more active agents which learn by intervening in the world the relationships between causes and effects the sort of objective functions which could be important to allow the highest level explanations to rise from the learning which i dont think we have now the kinds of objective functions which could be used to reward exploration the right kind of exploration so these kinds of questions are neither in the data set nor in the architecture but more in how we learn under what objectives and so on yeah ive heard you mention in several contexts the idea of sort of the way children learn they interact with objects in the world and it seems fascinating because in some sense except with some cases in reinforcement learning that idea is not part of the learning process in artificial neural networks so its almost like do you envision something like an objective function saying you know what if you poke this object in this kind of way it would be really helpful for me to further learn right right sort of almost guiding some aspect of the learning right right right so i was talking to rebecca sacks just a few minutes ago and she was talking about lots and lots of evidence from infants seem to clearly pick what interests them in a directed way and so theyre not passive learners they focus their attention on aspects of the world which are most interesting surprising in a non trivial way that makes them change their theories of the world so thats a fascinating view of the future progress but on a more maybe boring question do you think going deeper and larger so do you think just increasing the size of the things that have been increasing a lot in the past few years is going to be a big thing i think increasing the size of the things that have been increasing a lot in the past few years will also make significant progress so some of the representational issues that you mentioned theyre kind of shallow in some sense oh shallow in the sense of abstraction in the sense of abstraction theyre not getting some i dont think that having more depth in the network in the sense of instead of 100 layers youre going to have more layers i dont think so is that obvious to you yes what is clear to me is that engineers and companies and labs and grad students will continue to tune architectures and explore all kinds of tweaks to make the current state of the art slightly ever slightly better but i dont think thats going to be nearly enough i think we need changes in the way that were considering learning to achieve the goal that these learners actually understand in a deep way the environment in which they are you know observing and acting but i guess i was trying to ask a question thats more interesting than just more layers its basically once you figure out a way to learn through interacting how many parameters it takes to store that information so i think our brain is quite bigger than most neural networks right right oh i see what you mean oh im with you there so i agree that in order to build neural nets with the kind of broad knowledge of the world that typical adult humans have probably the kind of computing power we have now is going to be insufficient so the good news is there are hardware companies building neural net chips and so its going to get better however the good news in a way which is also a bad news is that even our state of the art deep learning methods fail to learn models that understand even very simple environments like some grid worlds that we have built even these fairly simple environments i mean of course if you train them with enough examples eventually they get it but its just like instead of what humans might need just dozens of examples these things will need millions for very very very simple tasks and so i think theres an opportunity for academics who dont have the kind of computing power that say google has to do really important and exciting research to advance the state of the art in training frameworks learning models agent learning in even simple environments that are synthetic that seem trivial but yet current machine learning fails on we talked about priors and common sense knowledge it seems like we humans take a lot of knowledge for granted so whats your view of these priors of forming this broad view of the world this accumulation of information and how we can teach neural networks or learning systems to pick that knowledge up so knowledge for a while the artificial intelligence was maybe in the 80s like theres a time where knowledge representation knowledge acquisition expert systems i mean the symbolic ai was a view was an interesting problem set to solve and it was kind of put on hold a little bit it seems like because it doesnt work it doesnt work thats right but thats right but the goals of that remain important yes remain important and how do you think those goals can be addressed right so first of all i believe that one reason why the classical expert systems approach failed is because a lot of the knowledge we have so you talked about common sense intuition theres a lot of knowledge like this which is not consciously accessible there are lots of decisions were taking that we cant really explain even if sometimes we make up a story and that knowledge is also necessary for machines to take good decisions and that knowledge is hard to codify in expert systems rule based systems and classical ai formalism and there are other issues of course with the old ai like not really good ways of handling uncertainty i would say something more subtle which we understand better now but i think still isnt enough in the minds of people theres something really powerful that comes from distributed representations the thing that really makes neural nets work so well and its hard to replicate that kind of power in a symbolic world the knowledge in expert systems and so on is nicely decomposed into like a bunch of rules whereas if you think about a neural net its the opposite you have this big blob of parameters which work intensely together to represent everything the network knows and its not sufficiently factorized its not sufficiently factorized and so i think this is one of the weaknesses of current neural nets that we have to take lessons from classical ai in order to bring in another kind of compositionality which is common in language for example and in these rules but that isnt so native to neural nets and on that line of thinking disentangled representations yes so let me connect with disentangled representations if you might if you dont mind so for many years ive thought and i still believe that its really important that we come up with learning algorithms either unsupervised or supervised but reinforcement whatever that build representations in which the important factors hopefully causal factors are nicely separated and easy to pick up from the representation so thats the idea of disentangled representations it says transform the data into a space where everything becomes easy we can maybe just learn with linear models about the things we care about and i still think this is important but i think this is missing out on a very important ingredient which classical ai systems can remind us of so lets say we have these disentangled representations you still need to learn about the relationships between the variables those high level semantic variables theyre not going to be independent i mean this is like too much of an assumption theyre going to have some interesting relationships that allow to predict things in the future to explain what happened in the past the kind of knowledge about those relationships in a classical ai system is encoded in the rules like a rule is just like a little piece of knowledge that says oh i have these two three four variables that are linked in this interesting way then i can say something about one or two of them given a couple of others right in addition to disentangling the elements of the representation which are like the variables in a rule based system you also need to disentangle the mechanisms that relate those variables to each other so like the rules so the rules are neatly separated like each rule is you know living on its own and when i change a rule because im learning it doesnt need to break other rules whereas current neural nets for example are very sensitive to whats called catastrophic forgetting where after ive learned some things and then i learn new things they can destroy the old things that i had learned right if the knowledge was better factorized and separated disentangled then you would avoid a lot of that now you cant do this in the sensory domain what do you mean by sensory domain like in pixel space but my idea is that when you project the data in the right semantic space it becomes possible to now represent this extra knowledge beyond the transformation from inputs to representations which is how representations act on each other and predict the future and so on in a way that can be neatly disentangled so now its the rules that are disentangled from each other and not just the variables that are disentangled from each other and you draw a distinction between semantic space and pixel like does there need to be an architectural difference well yeah so theres the sensory space like pixels which where everything is entangled the information like the variables are completely interdependent in very complicated ways and also computation like its not just the variables its also how they are related to each other is all intertwined but im hypothesizing that in the right high level representation space both the variables and how they relate to each other can be disentangled and that will provide a lot of generalization power generalization power yes distribution of the test set is assumed to be the same as the distribution of the training set right this is where current machine learning is too weak it doesnt tell us anything is not able to tell us anything about how our neural nets say are going to generalize to a new distribution and you know people may think well but theres nothing we can say if we dont know what the new distribution will be the truth is humans are able to generalize to new distributions yeah how are we able to do that yeah because there is something these new distributions even though they could look very different from the training distributions they have things in common so let me give you a concrete example you read a science fiction novel the science fiction novel maybe you know brings you in some other planet where things look very different on the surface but its still the same laws of physics and so you can read the book and you understand whats going on so the distribution is very different but because you can transport a lot of the knowledge you had from earth about the underlying cause and effect relationships and physical mechanisms and all that and maybe even social interactions you can now make sense of what is going on on this planet where like visually for example things are totally different taking that analogy further and distorting it lets enter a science fiction world of say space odyssey 2001 with hal or maybe which is probably one of my favorite ai movies me too and then theres another one that a lot of people love that may be a little bit outside of the ai community is ex machina i dont know if youve seen it yes yes by the way what are your views on that movie are you able to enjoy it are there things i like and things i hate so you could talk about that in the context of a question i want to ask which is theres quite a large community of people from different backgrounds often outside of ai who are concerned about existential threat of artificial intelligence youve seen this community develop over time youve seen you have a perspective so what do you think is the best way to talk about ai safety to think about it to have discourse about it within ai community and outside and grounded in the fact that ex machina is one of the main sources of information for the general public about ai so i think youre putting it right theres a big difference between the sort of discussion we ought to have within the ai community and the sort of discussion that really matter in the general public so i think the picture of terminator and ai loose and killing people and super intelligence thats going to destroy us whatever we try isnt really so useful for the public discussion because for the public discussion the things i believe really matter are the short term and medium term very likely negative impacts of ai on society whether its from security like you know big brother scenarios with face recognition or killer robots or the impact on the job market or concentration of power and discrimination all kinds of social issues which could actually some of them could really threaten democracy for example just to clarify when you said killer robots you mean autonomous weapon weapon systems yes i dont mean thats right so i think these short and medium term concerns should be important parts of the public debate now existential risk for me is a very unlikely consideration but still worth academic investigation in the same way that you could say should we study what could happen if meteorite you know came to earth and destroyed it so i think its very unlikely that this is going to happen in or happen in a reasonable future the sort of scenario of an ai getting loose goes against my understanding of at least current machine learning and current neural nets and so on its not plausible to me but of course i dont have a crystal ball and who knows what ai will be in 50 years from now so i think it is worth that scientists study those problems its just not a pressing question as far as im concerned so before i continue down that line i have a few questions there but what do you like and not like about ex machina as a movie because i actually watched it for the second time and enjoyed it i hated it the first time and i enjoyed it quite a bit more the second time when i sort of learned to accept certain pieces of it see it as a concept movie what was your experience what were your thoughts so the negative is the picture it paints of science is totally wrong science in general and ai in particular science is not happening in some hidden place by some you know really smart guy one person this is totally unrealistic this is not how it happens even a team of people in some isolated place will not make it science moves by small steps thanks to the collaboration and community of a large number of people interacting and all the scientists who are expert in their field kind of know what is going on even in the industrial labs its information flows and leaks and so on and the spirit of it is very different from the way science is painted in this movie yeah let me ask on that point its been the case to this point that kind of even if the research happens inside google or facebook inside companies it still kind of comes out ideas come out do you think that will always be the case with ai is it possible to bottle ideas to the point where theres a set of breakthroughs that go completely undiscovered by the general research community do you think thats even possible its possible but its unlikely its not how it is done now its not how i can foresee it in the foreseeable future but of course i dont have a crystal ball and science is a crystal ball and so who knows this is science fiction after all i think its ominous that the lights went off during that discussion so the problem again theres one thing is the movie and you could imagine all kinds of science fiction the problem for me maybe similar to the question about existential risk is that this kind of movie paints such a wrong picture of what is the actual science and how its going on that it can have unfortunate effects on peoples understanding of current science and so thats kind of sad theres an important principle in research which is diversity so in other words research is exploration research is exploration in the space of ideas and different people will focus on different directions and this is not just good its essential so im totally fine with people exploring directions that are contrary to mine or look orthogonal to mine i am more than fine i think its important i and my friends dont claim we have universal truth about what will especially about what will happen in the future now that being said we have our intuitions and then we act accordingly according to where we think we can be most useful and where society has the most to gain or to lose we should have those debates and not end up in a society where theres only one voice and one way of thinking and research money is spread out so disagreement is a sign of good research good science yes the idea of bias in the human sense of bias how do you think about instilling in machine learning something thats aligned with human values in terms of bias we intuitively as human beings have a concept of what bias means of what fundamental respect for other human beings means but how do we instill that into machine learning systems do you think so i think there are short term things that are already happening and then there are long term things that we need to do in the short term there are techniques that have been proposed and i think will continue to be improved and maybe alternatives will come up to take data sets in which we know there is bias we can measure it pretty much any data set where humans are being observed taking decisions will have some sort of bias discrimination against particular groups and so on and we can use machine learning techniques to try to build predictors classifiers that are going to be less biased we can do it for example using adversarial methods to make our systems less sensitive to these variables we should not be sensitive to so these are clear well defined ways of trying to address the problem maybe they have weaknesses and more research is needed and so on but i think in fact they are sufficiently mature that governments should start regulating companies where it matters say like insurance companies so that they use those techniques because those techniques will probably reduce the bias but at a cost for example maybe their predictions will be less accurate and so companies will not do it until you force them all right so this is short term long term im really interested in thinking how we can instill moral values into computers obviously this is not something well achieve in the next five or 10 years how can we you know theres already work in detecting emotions for example in images in sounds in texts and also studying how different agents interacting in different ways may correspond to patterns of say injustice which could trigger anger so these are things we can do in the medium term and eventually train computers to model for example how humans react emotionally i would say the simplest thing is unfair situations which trigger anger this is one of the most basic emotions that we share with other animals i think its quite feasible within the next few years that we can build systems that can detect these kinds of things to the extent unfortunately that they understand enough about the world around us which is a long time away but maybe we can initially do this in virtual environments so you can imagine a video game where agents interact in some ways and then some situations trigger an emotion i think we could train machines to detect those situations and predict that the particular emotion will likely be felt if a human was playing one of the characters you have shown excitement and done a lot of excellent work with unsupervised learning but theres been a lot of success on the supervised learning side yes yes and one of the things im really passionate about is how humans and robots work together and in the context of supervised learning that means the process of annotation do you think about the problem of annotation put in a more interesting way as humans teaching machines yes is there yes i think its an important subject reducing it to annotation may be useful for somebody building a system tomorrow but longer term the process of teaching i think is something that deserves a lot more attention from the machine learning community so there are people who have coined the term machine teaching so what are good strategies for teaching a learning agent and can we design and train a system that is going to be a good teacher so in my group we have a project called bbi or bbi game where there is a game or scenario where theres a learning agent and a teaching agent presumably the teaching agent would eventually be a human but were not there yet and the role of the teacher is to use its knowledge of the environment which it can acquire using whatever way brute force to help the learner learn as quickly as possible so the learner is going to try to learn by itself maybe using some exploration and whatever but the teacher can choose can have an influence on the interaction with the learner so as to guide the learner maybe teach it the things that the learner has most trouble with or just add the boundary between what it knows and doesnt know and so on so theres a tradition of these kind of ideas from other fields and like tutorial systems for example and ai and of course people in the humanities have been thinking about these questions but i think its time that machine learning people look at this because in the future well have more and more human machine interaction with the human in the loop and i think understanding how to make this work better all the problems around that are very interesting and not sufficiently addressed youve done a lot of work with language too what aspect of the traditionally formulated turing test a test of natural language understanding and generation in your eyes is the most difficult of conversation what in your eyes is the hardest part of conversation to solve for machines so i would say its everything having to do with the non linguistic knowledge which implicitly you need in order to make sense of sentences things like the winograd schema so these sentences that are semantically ambiguous in other words you need to understand enough about the world in order to really interpret properly those sentences i think these are interesting challenges for machine learning because they point in the direction of building systems that both understand how the world works and this causal relationships in the world and associate that knowledge with how to express it in language either for reading or writing you speak french yes its my mother tongue its one of the romance languages do you think passing the turing test and all the underlying challenges we just mentioned depend on language do you think it might be easier in french than it is in english or is independent of language i think its independent of language i would like to build systems that can use the same principles the same learning mechanisms to learn from human agents whatever their language well certainly us humans can talk more beautifully and smoothly in poetry some russian originally i know poetry in russian is maybe easier to convey complex ideas than it is in english but maybe im showing my bias and some people could say that about french but of course the goal ultimately is our human brain is able to utilize any kind of those languages to use them as tools to convey meaning yeah of course there are differences between languages and maybe some are slightly better at some things but in the grand scheme of things where were trying to understand how the brain works and language and so on i think these differences are minute so youve lived perhaps through an ai winter of sorts yes how did you stay warm and continue your research stay warm with friends with friends okay so its important to have friends and what have you learned from the experience listen to your inner voice dont you know be trying to just please the crowds and the fashion and if you have a strong intuition about something that is not contradicted by actual evidence go for it i mean it could be contradicted by people not your own instinct of based on everything youve learned of course you have to adapt your beliefs when your experiments contradict those beliefs but you have to stick to your beliefs otherwise its what allowed me to go through those years its what allowed me to persist in directions that you know took time whatever other people think took time to mature and bring fruits so history of ai is marked with these of course its marked with technical breakthroughs but its also marked with these seminal events that capture the imagination of the community most recent i would say alphago beating the world champion human go player was one of those moments what do you think the next such moment might be okay so first of all i think that these so called seminal events are overrated as i said science really moves by small steps now what happens is you make one more small step and its like the drop that you know that fills the bucket and then you have drastic consequences because now youre able to do something you were not able to do before or now say the cost of building some device or solving a problem becomes cheaper than what existed and you have a new market that opens up right so especially in the world of commerce and applications the impact of a small scientific progress could be huge but in the science itself i think its very very gradual and where are these steps being taken now so theres unsupervised learning so if i look at one trend that i like in my community so for example at milan my institute what are the two hardest topics gans and reinforcement learning even though in montreal in particular reinforcement learning was something pretty much absent just two or three years ago so theres really a big interest from students and theres a big interest from people like me so i would say this is something where were going to see more progress even though it hasnt yet provided much in terms of actual industrial fallout like even though theres alphago theres no like google is not making money on this right now but i think over the long term this is really really important for many reasons so in other words i would say reinforcement learning may be more generally agent learning because it doesnt have to be with rewards it could be in all kinds of ways that an agent is learning about its environment now reinforcement learning youre excited about do you think gans could provide something at the moment well gans or other generative models i believe will be crucial ingredients in building agents that can understand the world a lot of the successes in reinforcement learning in the past has been with policy gradient where you just learn a policy you dont actually learn a model of the world but there are lots of issues with that and we dont know how to do model based rl right now but i think this is where we have to go in order to build models that can generalize faster and better like to new distributions that capture to some extent at least the underlying causal mechanisms in the world last question what made you fall in love with artificial intelligence if you look back what was the first moment in your life when you were fascinated by either the human mind or the artificial mind you know when i was an adolescent i was reading a lot and then i started reading science fiction there you go thats it thats where i got hooked and then you know i had one of the first personal computers and i got hooked in programming and so it just you know start with fiction and then make it a reality thats right yoshua thank you so much for talking to me my pleasure',\n",
       " 'the following is a conversation with vladimir vapnik hes the co inventor of support vector machines support vector clustering vc theory and many foundational ideas in statistical learning he was born in the soviet union and worked at the institute of control sciences in moscow then in the united states he worked at att nec labs facebook research and now is a professor at columbia university his work has been cited over 170000 times he has some very interesting ideas about artificial intelligence and the nature of learning especially on the limits of our current approaches and the open problems in the field this conversation is part of mit course on artificial general intelligence and the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it please subscribe on youtube or rate it on itunes or your podcast provider of choice or simply connect with me on twitter or other social networks at lex friedman spelled f r i d and now heres my conversation with vladimir vapnik einstein famously said that god doesnt play dice yeah you have studied the world through the eyes of statistics so let me ask you in terms of the nature of reality fundamental nature of reality does god play dice we dont know some factors and because we dont know some factors which could be important it looks like god plays dice but we should describe it in philosophy they distinguish between two positions positions of instrumentalism where youre creating theory for prediction and position of realism where youre trying to understand what god did can you describe instrumentalism and realism a little bit for example if you have some mechanical laws what is that is it law which is true always and everywhere or it is law which allow you to predict position of moving element what you believe you believe that it is gods law that god created the world which obey to this physical law or it is just law for predictions and which one is instrumentalism for predictions if you believe that this is law of god and its always true everywhere that means that youre realist so youre trying to really understand gods thought so the way you see the world is as an instrumentalist you know im working for some models model of machine learning so in this model we can see setting and we try to solve resolve the setting to solve the problem and you can do in two different way from the point of view of instrumentalist and thats what everybody does now because they say that goal of machine learning is to find the rule for classification that is true but it is instrument for prediction but i can say the goal of machine learning is to learn about conditional probability so how god played use and if he play what is probability for one what is probability for another given situation but for prediction i dont need this i need the rule but for understanding i need conditional probability so let me just step back a little bit first to talk about you mentioned which i read last night the parts of the 1960 paper by eugene wigner unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics and natural sciences such a beautiful paper by the way made me feel to be honest to confess my own work in the past few years on deep learning heavily applied made me feel that i was missing out on some of the beauty of nature in the way that math can uncover so let me just step away from the poetry of that for a second how do you see the role of math in your life is it a tool is it poetry where does it sit and does math for you have limits of what it can describe some people say that math is language which use god use god so i believe that speak to god or use god or use god use god yeah so i believe that this article about effectiveness unreasonable effectiveness of math is that if youre looking at mathematical structures they know something about reality and the most scientists from natural science theyre looking on equation and trying to understand reality so the same in machine learning if you try very carefully look on all equations which define conditional probability you can understand something about reality more than from your fantasy so math can reveal the simple underlying principles of reality perhaps you know what means simple it is very hard to discover them but then when you discover them and look at them you see how beautiful they are and it is surprising why people did not see that before youre looking on equation and derive it from equations for example i talked yesterday about least square method and people had a lot of fantasy how to improve least square method but if youre going step by step by solving some equations you suddenly will get some term which after thinking you understand that it describes position of observation point in least square method we throw out a lot of information we dont look in composition of point of observations were looking only on residuals but when you understood that thats very simple idea but its not too simple to understand and you can derive this just from equations so some simple algebra a few steps will take you to something surprising that when you think about you understand and that is proof that human intuition is not too rich and very primitive and it does not see very simple situations so let me take a step back in general yes but what about human as opposed to intuition ingenuity moments of brilliance do you have to be so hard on human intuition are there moments of brilliance in human intuition they can leap ahead of math and then the math will catch up i dont think so i think that the best human intuition it is putting in axioms and then it is technical see where the axioms take you but if they correctly take axioms but it axiom polished during generations of scientists and this is integral wisdom that is beautifully put but if you maybe look at when you think of einstein and special relativity what is the role of imagination coming first there in the moment of discovery of an idea so there is obviously a mix of math and out of the box imagination there that i dont know whatever i did i exclude any imagination because whatever i saw in machine learning that comes from imagination like features like deep learning they are not relevant to the problem when you are looking very carefully from mathematical equations you are deriving very simple theory which goes far beyond theoretically than whatever people can imagine because it is not good fantasy it is just interpretation it is just fantasy but it is not what you need you dont need any imagination to derive the main principle of machine learning when you think about learning and intelligence maybe thinking about the human brain and trying to describe mathematically the process of learning that is something like what happens in the human brain do you think we have the tools currently do you think we will ever have the tools to try to describe that process of learning it is not description what is going on it is interpretation it is your interpretation your vision can be wrong you know one guy invented microscope levenhuk for the first time only he got this instrument and he kept secret about microscope but he wrote a report in london academy of science in his report when he was looking at the blood he looked everywhere on the water on the blood on the sperm but he described blood like fight between queen and king so he saw blood cells red cells and he imagined that it is army fighting each other and it was his interpretation of situation and he sent this report in academy of science they very carefully looked because they believed that he is right he saw something yes but he gave wrong interpretation and i believe the same can happen with brain with brain yeah the most important part you know i believe in human language in some proverbs there is so much wisdom for example people say that it is better than thousand days of diligent studies one day with great teacher but if i will ask you what teacher does nobody knows and that is intelligence but we know from history and now from math and machine learning that teacher can do a lot so what from a mathematical point of view is the great teacher i dont know thats an open question no but we can say what teacher can do he can introduce some invariants some predicate for creating invariants how he doing it i dont know because teacher knows reality and can describe from this reality a predicate invariants but he knows that when youre using invariant you can decrease number of observations hundred times so but maybe try to pull that apart a little bit i think you mentioned like a piano teacher saying to the student play like a butterfly yeah i play piano i play guitar for a long time yeah maybe its romantic poetic but it feels like theres a lot of truth in that statement like there is a lot of instruction in that statement and so can you pull that apart what is that the language itself may not contain this information it is not blah blah blah it is not blah blah blah it affects you its what it affects you it affects your playing yes it does but its not the laying it feels like what is the information being exchanged there what is the nature of information what is the representation of that information i believe that it is sort of predicate but i dont know that is exactly what intelligence and machine learning should be yes because the rest is just mathematical technique i think that what was discovered recently is that there is two mechanism of learning one called strong convergence mechanism and weak convergence mechanism before people use only one convergence in weak convergence mechanism you can use predicate thats what play like butterfly and it will immediately affect your playing you know there is english proverb great if it looks like a duck swims like a duck and quack like a duck then it is probably duck yes but this is exact about predicate looks like a duck what it means you saw many ducks that youre training data so you have description of how looks integral looks ducks yeah the visual characteristics of a duck yeah but you want and you have model for recognition so you would like so that theoretical description from model coincide with empirical description which you saw on territory so about looks like a duck it is general but what about swims like a duck you should know that duck swims you can say it play chess like a duck okay duck doesnt play chess and it is completely legal predicate but it is useless so half teacher can recognize not useless predicate so up to now we dont use this predicate in existing machine learning so why we need zillions of data but in this english proverb they use only three predicate looks like a duck swims like a duck and quack like a duck so you cant deny the fact that swims like a duck and quacks like a duck has humor in it has ambiguity lets talk about swim like a duck it doesnt say jump like a duck why because its not relevant but that means that you know ducks you know different birds you know animals and you derive from this that it is relevant to say swim like a duck so underneath in order for us to understand swims like a duck it feels like we need to know millions of other little pieces of information which we pick up along the way you dont think so there doesnt need to be this knowledge base in those statements carries some rich information that helps us understand the essence of duck yeah how far are we from integrating predicates you know that when you consider complete theory of machine learning so what it does you have a lot of functions and then youre talking it looks like a duck you see your training data from training data you recognize like expected duck should look then you remove all functions which does not look like you think it should look from training data so you decrease amount of function from which you pick up one then you give a second predicate and again decrease the set of function and after that you pick up the best function you can find it is standard machine learning so why you need not too many examples because your predicates arent very good that means that predicates are very good because every predicate is invented to decrease admissible set of function so you talk about admissible set of functions and you talk about good functions so what makes a good function so admissible set of function is set of function which has small capacity or small diversity small vc dimension example which contain good function inside so by the way for people who dont know vc youre the v in the vc so how would you describe to lay person what vc theory is how would you describe vc so when you have a machine so machine capable to pick up one function from the admissible set of function but set of admissible function can be big so it contain all continuous functions and its useless you dont have so many examples to pick up function but it can be small small we call it capacity but maybe better called diversity so not very different function in the set its infinite set of function but not very diverse so it is small vc dimension when vc dimension is small you need small amount of training data so the goal is to create admissible set of functions which is have small vc dimension and contain good function then you will be able to pick up the function using small amount of observations so that is the task of learning yeah is creating a set of admissible functions that has a small vc dimension and then youve figure out a clever way of picking up no that is goal of learning which i formulated yesterday statistical learning theory does not involve in creating admissible set of function in classical learning theory everywhere 100 in textbook the set of function admissible set of function is given but this is science about nothing because the most difficult problem to create admissible set of functions given say a lot of functions continuum set of function create admissible set of functions that means that it has finite vc dimension small vc dimension and contain good function so this was out of consideration so whats the process of doing that i mean its fascinating what is the process of creating this admissible set of functions that is invariant thats invariant yeah youre looking of properties of training data and properties means that you have some function and you just count what is value average value of function on training data you have model and what is expectation of this function on the model and they should coincide so the problem is about how to pick up functions it can be any function in fact it is true for all functions but because when were talking say duck does not jumping so you dont ask question jump like a duck because it is trivial it does not jumping and doesnt help you to recognize jump but you know something which question to ask and youre asking it seems like a duck but looks like a duck at this general situation looks like say guy who have this illness this disease it is legal so there is a general type of predicate looks like and special type of predicate which related to this specific problem and that is intelligence part of all this business and that where teacher is involved incorporating the specialized predicates what do you think about deep learning as neural networks these arbitrary architectures as helping accomplish some of the tasks youre thinking about their effectiveness or lack thereof what are the weaknesses and what are the possible strengths you know i think that this is fantasy everything which like deep learning like features let me give you this example one of the greatest books is churchill book about history of second world war and he started this book describing that in old time when war is over so the great kings they gathered together almost all of them were relatives and they discussed what should be done how to create peace and they came to agreement and when happened first world war the general public came in power and they were so greedy that robbed germany and it was clear for everybody that it is not peace that peace will last only 20 years because they were not professionals and the same i see in machine learning there are mathematicians who are looking for the problem from a very deep point of view mathematical point of view and there are computer scientists who mostly does not know mathematics they just have interpretation of that and they invented a lot of blah blah blah interpretations like deep learning why you need deep learning mathematic does not know deep learning mathematic does not know neurons it is just function if you like to say piecewise linear function say that and do in class of piecewise linear function but they invent something and then they try to prove advantage of that through interpretations which mostly wrong and when its not enough they appeal to brain which they know nothing about that nobody knows whats going on in the brain so i think that more reliable work on math this is a mathematical problem do your best to solve this problem try to understand that there is not only one way of convergence which is strong way of convergence there is a weak way of convergence which requires predicate and if you will go through all this stuff you will see that you dont need deep learning even more i would say one of the theory which called represented theory it says that optimal solution of mathematical problem which is described learning is on shadow network not on deep learning and a shallow network yeah the ultimate problem is there absolutely in the end what youre saying is exactly right the question is you have no value for throwing something on the table playing with it not math its like a neural network where you said throwing something in the bucket or the biological example and looking at kings and queens or the cells or the microscope you dont see value in imagining the cells or kings and queens and using that as inspiration and imagination for where the math will eventually lead you you think that interpretation basically deceives you in a way thats not productive i think that if youre trying to analyze this business of learning and especially discussion about deep learning it is discussion about interpretation not about things about what you can say about things thats right but arent you surprised by the beauty of it so not mathematical beauty but the fact that it works at all or are you criticizing that very beauty our human desire to interpret to find our silly interpretations in these constructs let me ask you this are you surprised and does it inspire you how do you feel about the success of a system like alphago at beating the game of go using neural networks to estimate the quality of a board and the quality of the position that is your interpretation quality of the board yeah yes yeah so its not our interpretation the fact is a neural network system it doesnt matter a learning system that we dont i think mathematically understand that well beats the best human player does something that was thought impossible that means that its not a very difficult problem so you empirically weve empirically have discovered that this is not a very difficult problem yeah its true so maybe cant argue so even more i would say that if they use deep learning it is not the most effective way of learning theory and usually when people use deep learning theyre using zillions of training data yeah but you dont need this so i describe challenge can we do some problems which do well deep learning method this deep net using hundred times less training data even more some problems deep learning cannot solve because its not necessary they create admissible set of function to create deep architecture means to create admissible set of functions you cannot say that youre creating good admissible set of functions you just its your fantasy it does not come from us but it is possible to create admissible set of functions because you have your training data that actually for mathematicians when you consider a variant you need to use law of large numbers when youre making training in existing algorithm you need uniform law of large numbers which is much more difficult it requires vc dimension and all this stuff but nevertheless if you use both weak and strong way of convergence you can decrease a lot of training data you could do the three the swims like a duck and quacks like a duck so lets step back and think about human intelligence in general clearly that has evolved in a non mathematical way it wasnt as far as we know god or whoever didnt come up with a model and place in our brain of admissible functions it kind of evolved i dont know maybe you have a view on this so alan turing in the 50s in his paper asked and rejected the question can machines think its not a very useful question but can you briefly entertain this useful useless question can machines think so talk about intelligence and your view of it i dont know that i know that turing described imitation if computer can imitate human being lets call it intelligent and he understands that it is not thinking computer he completely understands what hes doing but he set up problem of imitation so now we understand that the problem is not in imitation im not sure that intelligence is just inside of us it may be also outside of us i have several observations so when i prove some theorem its very difficult theorem in couple of years in several places people prove the same theorem say sawyer lemma after us was done then another guys proved the same theorem in the history of science its happened all the time for example geometry its happened simultaneously first it did lobachevsky and then gauss and boyai and another guys and its approximately in 10 times period 10 years period of time and i saw a lot of examples like that and many mathematicians think that when they develop something they develop something in general which affect everybody so maybe our model that intelligence is only inside of us is incorrect its our interpretation it might be there exists some connection with world intelligence i dont know youre almost like plugging in into yeah exactly and contributing to this into a big network into a big maybe in your own network on the flip side of that maybe you can comment on big o complexity and how you see classifying algorithms by worst case running time in relation to their input so that way of thinking about functions do you think p equals np do you think thats an interesting question yeah it is an interesting question but let me talk about complexity in about worst case scenario there is a mathematical setting when i came to united states in 1990 people did not know they did not know statistical learning theory so in russia it was published to monographs our monographs but in america they didnt know then they learned and somebody told me that it is worst case theory and they will create real case theory but till now it did not because it is mathematical too you can do only what you can do using mathematics and which has a clear understanding and clear description and for this reason we introduce complexity and we need this because using actually it is diversity i like this one more you see the mention you can prove some theorems but we also create theory for case when you know probability measure and that is the best case which can happen it is entropy theory so from mathematical point of view you know the best possible case and the worst possible case you can derive different model in medium but its not so interesting you think the edges are interesting the edges are interesting because it is not so easy to get good bound exact bound its not many cases where you have the bound is not exact but interesting principles which discover the mass do you think its interesting because its challenging and reveals interesting principles that allow you to get those bounds or do you think its interesting because its actually very useful for understanding the essence of a function of an algorithm so its like me judging your life as a human being by the worst thing you did and the best thing you did versus all the stuff in the middle it seems not productive i dont think so because you cannot describe situation in the middle so it will be not general so you can describe edges cases and it is clear it has some model but you cannot describe model for every new case so you will be never accurate when youre using model but from a statistical point of view the way youve studied functions and the nature of learning in the world dont you think that the real world has a very long tail that the edge cases are very far away from the mean the stuff in the middle or no i dont know that i think that from my point of view if you will use formal statistic you need uniform law of large numbers if you will use this invariance business you will need just law of large numbers and theres this huge difference between uniform law of large numbers and large numbers is it useful to describe that a little more or should we just take it to for example when im talking about duck i give three predicates and that was enough but if you will try to do formal distinguish you will need a lot of observations so that means that information about looks like a duck contain a lot of bit of information formal bits of information so we dont know that how much bit of information contain things from artificial and from intelligence and that is the subject of analysis till now all business i dont like how people consider artificial intelligence they consider us some codes which imitate activity of human being it is not science it is applications you would like to imitate go ahead it is very useful and a good problem but you need to learn something more how people try to do how people can to develop say predicates seems like a duck or play like butterfly or something like that not the teacher says you how it came in his mind how he choose this image so that process that is problem of intelligence that is the problem of intelligence and you see that connected to the problem of learning absolutely because you immediately give this predicate like specific predicate seems like a duck or quack like a duck it was chosen somehow so what is the line of work would you say if you were to formulate as a set of open problems that will take us there to play like a butterfly well get a system to be able to lets separate two stories one mathematical story that if you have predicate you can do something and another story how to get predicate it is intelligence problem and people even did not start to understand intelligence because to understand intelligence first of all try to understand what do teachers how teacher teach why one teacher better than another one yeah and so you think we really even havent started on the journey of generating the predicates no we dont understand we even dont understand that this problem exists because did you hear you do no i just know name i want to understand why one teacher better than another and how affect teacher student it is not because he repeating the problem which is in textbook he makes some remarks he makes some philosophy of reasoning yeah thats a beautiful so it is a formulation of a question that is the open problem why is one teacher better than another right what he does better yeah what what why in at every level how do they get better what does it mean to be better the whole yeah yeah from whatever model i have one teacher can give a very good predicate one teacher can say swims like a dog and another can say jump like a dog and jump like a dog carries zero information so what is the most exciting problem in statistical learning youve ever worked on or are working on now i just finished this invariant story and im happy that i believe that it is ultimate learning story at least i can show that there are no another mechanism only two mechanisms but they separate statistical part from intelligent part and i know nothing about intelligent part and if you will know this intelligent part so it will help us a lot in teaching in learning in learning yeah you will know it when we see it so for example in my talk the last slide was a challenge so you have say nist digit recognition problem and deep learning claims that they did it very well say 995 of correct answers but they use 60000 observations can you do the same using hundred times less but incorporating invariants what it means you know digit one two three but looking on that explain to me which invariant i should keep to use hundred examples or say hundred times less examples to do the same job yeah that last slide unfortunately your talk ended quickly but that last slide was a powerful open challenge and a formulation of the essence here what is the exact problem of intelligence because everybody when machine learning started and it was developed by mathematicians they immediately recognized that we use much more training data than humans needed but now again we came to the same story have to decrease that is the problem of learning it is not like in deep learning they use zillions of training data because maybe zillions are not enough if you have a good invariants maybe you will never collect some number of observations but now it is a question to intelligence how to do that because statistical part is ready as soon as you supply us with predicate we can do good job with small amount of observations and the very first challenge is well known digit recognition and you know digits and please tell me invariants i think about that i can say for digit three i would introduce concept of horizontal symmetry so the digit three has horizontal symmetry say more than say digit two or something like that but as soon as i get the idea of horizontal symmetry i can mathematically invent a lot of measure of horizontal symmetry or then vertical symmetry or diagonal symmetry whatever if i have idea of symmetry but what else i think on digit i see that it is meta predicate which is not shape it is something like symmetry like how dark is whole picture something like that which can self rise a predicate you think such a predicate could rise out of something that is not general meaning it feels like for me to be able to understand the difference between two and three i would need to have had a childhood of 10 to 15 years playing with kids going to school being yelled by parents all of that walking jumping looking at ducks and then i would be able to generate the right predicate for telling the difference between two and a three or do you think theres a more efficient way i dont know i know for sure that you must know something more than digits yes and thats a powerful statement yeah but maybe there are several languages of description these elements of digits so im talking about symmetry about some properties of geometry im talking about something abstract i dont know that but this is a problem of intelligence so in one of our articles it is trivial to show that every example can carry not more than one bit of information in real because when you show example and you say this is one you can remove say a function which does not tell you one say is the best strategy if you can do it perfectly its remove half of the functions but when you use one predicate which looks like a duck you can remove much more functions than half and that means that it contains a lot of bit of information from formal point of view but when you have a general picture of what you want to recognize and general picture of the world can you invent this predicate and that predicate carries a lot of information beautifully put maybe just me but in all the math you show in your work which is some of the most profound mathematical work in the field of learning ai and just math in general i hear a lot of poetry and philosophy you really kind of talk about philosophy of science theres a poetry and music to a lot of the work youre doing and the way youre thinking about it so do you where does that come from do you escape to poetry do you escape to music or not i think that there exists ground truth there exists ground truth yeah and that can be seen everywhere the smart guy philosopher sometimes im surprised how they deep see sometimes i see that some of them are completely out of subject but the ground truth i see in music music is the ground truth yeah and in poetry many poets they believe they take dictation so what piece of music as a piece of empirical evidence gave you a sense that they are touching something in the ground truth it is structure the structure of the math of music yeah because when youre listening to bach you see the structure very clear very classic very simple and the same in math when you have axioms in geometry you have the same feeling and in poetry sometimes you see the same and if you look back at your childhood you grew up in russia you maybe were born as a researcher in russia youve developed as a researcher in russia youve came to united states and a few places if you look back what was some of your happiest moments as a researcher some of the most profound moments not in terms of their impact on society but in terms of their impact on how damn good you feel that day and you remember that moment you know every time when you found something it is great in the life every simple things but my general feeling is that most of my time was wrong you should go again and again and again and try to be honest in front of yourself not to make interpretation but try to understand that its related to ground truth it is not my blah blah blah interpretation and something like that but youre allowed to get excited at the possibility of discovery oh yeah you have to double check it no but how its related to another ground truth is it just temporary or it is for forever you know you always have a feeling when you found something how big is that so 20 years ago when we discovered statistical learning theory nobody believed except for one guy dudley from mit and then in 20 years it became fashion and the same with support vector machines that is kernel machines so with support vector machines and learning theory when you were working on it you had a sense you had a sense of the profundity of it how this seems to be right this seems to be powerful right absolutely immediately i recognized that it will last forever and now when i found this invariant story i have a feeling that it is complete learning because i have proof that there are no different mechanisms you can have some cosmetic improvement you can do but in terms of invariants you need both invariants and statistical learning and they should work together but also im happy that we can formulate what is intelligence from that and to separate from technical part and that is completely different absolutely well vladimir thank you so much for talking today thank you its an honor',\n",
       " 'the following is a conversation with guido van rossum creator of python one of the most popular programming languages in the world used in almost any application that involves computers from web back end development to psychology neuroscience computer vision robotics deep learning natural language processing and almost any subfield of ai this conversation is part of mit course on artificial general intelligence and the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it subscribe on youtube itunes or your podcast provider of choice or simply connect with me on twitter at lex friedman spelled f r i d and now heres my conversation with guido van rossum you were born in the netherlands in 1956 your parents and the world around you was deeply deeply impacted by world war two as was my family from the soviet union so with that context what is your view of human nature are some humans inherently good and some inherently evil or do we all have both good and evil within us guido van rossum ouch i did not expect such a deep one i i guess we all have good and evil potential in us and a lot of it depends on circumstances and context peter bell out of that world at least on the soviet union side in europe sort of out of suffering out of challenge out of that kind of set of traumatic events often emerges beautiful art music literature in an interview i read or heard you said you enjoyed dutch literature when you were a child can you tell me about the books that had an influence on you in your childhood guido van rossum well with as a teenager my favorite writer was my favorite dutch author was a guy named willem frederik hermans whos writing certainly his early novels were all about sort of ambiguous things that happened during world war two i think he was a young adult during that time and he wrote about it a lot and very interesting very good books i thought i think peter bell in a nonfiction way guido van rossum no it was all fiction but it was very much set in the ambiguous world of resistance against the germans where often you couldnt tell whether someone was truly in the resistance or really a spy for the germans and some of the characters in his novels sort of crossed that line and you never really find out what exactly happened peter bell and in his novels theres always a good guy and a bad guy the nature of good and evil is it clear theres a hero guido van rossum no his heroes are often more his main characters are often anti heroes and so theyre not very heroic theyre often they fail at some level to accomplish their lofty goals peter bell and looking at the trajectory through the rest of your life has literature dutch or english or translation had an impact outside the technical world that you existed in guido van rossum i still read novels i dont think that it impacts me that much directly peter bell it doesnt impact your work guido van rossum its a separate world my work is highly technical and sort of the world of art and literature doesnt really directly have any bearing on it peter bell you dont think theres a creative element to the design you know some would say design of a language is art guido van rossum im not disagreeing with that im just saying that sort of i dont feel direct influences from more traditional art on my own creativity peter bell right of course you dont feel doesnt mean its not somehow deeply there in your subconscious guido van rossum who knows peter bell who knows so lets go back to your early teens your hobbies were building electronic circuits building mechanical models what if you can just put yourself back in the mind of that young guido 12 13 14 was that grounded in a desire to create a system so to create something or was it more just tinkering just the joy of puzzle solving guido van rossum i think it was more the latter actually i maybe towards the end of my high school period i felt confident enough that that i designed my own circuits that were sort of interesting somewhat but a lot of that time i literally just took a model kit and follow the instructions putting the things together i mean i think the first few years that i built electronics kits i really did not have enough understanding of sort of electronics to really understand what i was doing i mean i could debug it and i could sort of follow the instructions very carefully which has always stayed with me but i had a very naive model of like how do i build a circuit of like how a transistor works and i dont think that in those days i had any understanding of coils and capacitors which actually sort of was a major problem when i started to build more complex digital circuits because i was unaware of the sort of the analog part of the – how they actually work and i would have things that – the schematic looked – everything looked fine and it didnt work and what i didnt realize was that there was some megahertz level oscillation that was throwing the circuit off because i had a sort of – two wires were too close or the switches were kind of poorly built but through that time i think its really interesting and instructive to think about because echoes of it are in this time now so in the 1970s the personal computer was being born so did you sense in tinkering with these circuits did you sense the encroaching revolution in personal computing so if at that point we would sit you down and ask you to predict the 80s and the 90s do you think you would be able to do so successfully to unroll the process thats happening no i had no clue i remember i think in the summer after my senior year – or maybe it was the summer after my junior year – well at some point i think when i was 18 i went on a trip to the math olympiad in eastern europe and there was like – i was part of the dutch team and there were other nerdy kids that sort of had different experiences and one of them told me about this amazing thing called a computer and i had never heard that word my own explorations in electronics were sort of about very simple digital circuits and i had sort of – i had the idea that i somewhat understood how a digital calculator worked and so there is maybe some echoes of computers there but i never made that connection i didnt know that when my parents were paying for magazine subscriptions using punched cards that there was something called a computer that was involved that read those cards and transferred the money between accounts i was also not really interested in those things it was only when i went to university to study math that i found out that they had a computer and students were allowed to use it and there were some – youre supposed to talk to that computer by programming it what did that feel like finding – yeah that was the only thing you could do with it the computer wasnt really connected to the real world the only thing you could do was sort of – you typed your program on a bunch of punched cards you gave the punched cards to the operator and an hour later the operator gave you back your printout and so all you could do was write a program that did something very abstract and i dont even remember what my first forays into programming were but they were sort of doing simple math exercises and just to learn how a programming language worked did you sense okay first year of college you see this computer youre able to have a program and it generates some output did you start seeing the possibility of this or was it a continuation of the tinkering with circuits did you start to imagine that one the personal computer but did you see it as something that is a tool like a word processing tool maybe for gaming or something or did you start to imagine that it could be going to the world of robotics like the frankenstein picture that you could create an artificial being theres like another entity in front of you you did not see the computer i dont think i really saw it that way i was really more interested in the tinkering its maybe not a sort of a complete coincidence that i ended up sort of creating a programming language which is a tool for other programmers ive always been very focused on the sort of activity of programming itself and not so much what happens with the program you write right i do remember and i dont remember maybe in my second or third year probably my second actually someone pointed out to me that there was this thing called conways game of life youre probably familiar with it i think – in the 70s i think is when they came up with it so there was a scientific american column by someone who did a monthly column about mathematical diversions im also blanking out on the guys name it was very famous at the time and i think up to the 90s or so and one of his columns was about conways game of life and he had some illustrations and he wrote down all the rules and sort of there was the suggestion that this was philosophically interesting that that was why conway had called it that and all i had was like the two pages photocopy of that article i dont even remember where i got it but it spoke to me and i remember implementing a version of that game for the batch computer we were using where i had a whole pascal program that sort of read an initial situation from input and read some numbers that said do so many generations and print every so many generations and then out would come pages and pages of sort of things i remember much later ive done a similar thing using python but that original version i wrote at the time i found interesting because i combined it with some trick i had learned during my electronics hobbyist times i essentially first on paper i designed a simple circuit built out of logic gates that took nine bits of input which is sort of the cell and its neighbors and produced a new value for that cell and its like a combination of a half adder and some other clipping its actually a full adder and so i had worked that out and then i translated that into a series of boolean operations on pascal integers where you could use the integers as bitwise values and so i could basically generate 60 bits of a generation in like eight instructions or so nice so i was proud of that its funny that you mentioned so for people who dont know conways game of life its a cellular automata where theres single compute units that kind of look at their neighbors and figure out what they look like in the next generation based on the state of their neighbors and this is deeply distributed system in concept at least and then theres simple rules that all of them follow and somehow out of this simple rule when you step back and look at what occurs its beautiful theres an emergent complexity even though the underlying rules are simple theres an emergent complexity now the funny thing is youve implemented this and the thing youre commenting on is youre proud of a hack you did to make it run efficiently when youre not commenting on its a beautiful implementation youre not commenting on the fact that theres an emergent complexity that youve coded a simple program and when you step back and you print out the following generation after generation thats stuff that you may have not predicted would happen is happening and is that magic i mean thats the magic that all of us feel when we program when you create a program and then you run it and whether its hello world or it shows something on screen if theres a graphical component are you seeing the magic in the mechanism of creating that i think i went back and forth as a student we had an incredibly small budget of computer time that we could use it was actually measured i once got in trouble with one of my professors because i had overspent the departments budget its a different story i actually wanted the efficient implementation because i also wanted to explore what would happen with a larger number of generations and a larger size of the board once the implementation was flawless i would feed it different patterns and then i think maybe there was a follow up article where there were patterns that were like gliders patterns that repeated themselves after a number of generations but translated one or two positions to the right or up or something like that i remember things like glider guns well you can google conways game of life people still go aww and ooh over it for a reason because its not really well understood why i mean this is what stephen wolfram is obsessed about we dont have the mathematical tools to describe the kind of complexity that emerges in these kinds of systems the only way you can do is to run it im not convinced that its sort of a problem that lends itself to classic mathematical analysis one theory of how you create an artificial intelligence or artificial being is you kind of have to same with the game of life you kind of have to create a universe and let it run that creating it from scratch in a design way coding up a python program that creates a fully intelligent system may be quite challenging you might need to create a universe just like the game of life you might have to experiment with a lot of different universes before there is a set of rules that doesnt essentially always just end up repeating itself in a trivial way yeah and stephen wolfram works with these simple rules says that its kind of surprising how quickly you find rules that create interesting things you shouldnt be able to but somehow you do and so maybe our universe is laden with rules that will create interesting things that might not look like humans but emergent phenomena thats interesting may not be as difficult to create as we think sure but let me sort of ask at that time some of the world at least in popular press was kind of captivated perhaps at least in america by the idea of artificial intelligence that these computers would be able to think pretty soon and did that touch you at all in science fiction or in reality in any way i didnt really start reading science fiction until much much later i think as a teenager i read maybe one bundle of science fiction stories was it in the background somewhere like in your thoughts that sort of the using computers to build something intelligent always felt to me because and how did you try to design it into the language there are different tasks and as a programmer its useful to have different tools available that sort of are suitable for different tasks so i still write c code i still write shell code but i write most of my things in python why do i still use those other languages because sometimes the task just demands it and well i would say most of the time the task actually demands a certain language because the task is not write a program that solves problem x from scratch but its more like fix a bug in existing program x or add a small feature to an existing large program but even if youre not constrained in your choice of language by context like that there is still the fact that if you write it in a certain language then you have this balance between how long does it take you to write the code and how long does the code run and when youre in the phase of exploring solutions you often spend much more time writing the code than running it because every time youve run it you see that the output is not quite what you wanted and you spend some more time coding and a language like python just makes that iteration much faster because there are fewer details that you have to get right before your program compiles and runs there are libraries that do all sorts of stuff for you so you can sort of very quickly take a bunch of existing components put them together and get your prototype application running just like when i was building electronics i was using a breadboard most of the time so i had this sprawl out circuit that if you shook it it would stop working because it was not put together very well but it functioned and all i wanted was to see that it worked and then move on to the next schematic or design or add something to it once youve sort of figured out oh this is the perfect design for my radio or light sensor or whatever then you can say okay how do we design a pcb for this how do we solder the components in a small space how do we make it so that it is robust against say voltage fluctuations or mechanical disruption i know nothing about that when it comes to designing electronics but i know a lot about that when it comes to writing code so the initial steps are efficient fast and theres not much stuff that gets in the way but youre kind of describing like darwin described the evolution of species right youre observing of what is true about python now if you take a step back if the act of creating languages is art and you had three months to do it initial steps so you just specified a bunch of goals sort of things that you observe about python perhaps you had those goals but how do you create the rules the syntactic structure the features that result in those so i have in the beginning and i have follow up questions about through the evolution of python too but in the very beginning when you were sitting there creating the lexical analyzer or whatever python was still a big part of it because i sort of i said to myself i dont want to have to design everything from scratch im going to borrow features from other languages that i like oh interesting so you basically exactly you first observe what you like yeah and so thats why if youre 17 years old and you want to sort of create a programming language youre not going to be very successful at it because you have no experience with other languages whereas i was in my lets say mid 30s i had written parsers before so i had worked on the implementation of abc i had spent years debating the design of abc with its authors with its designers i had nothing to do with the design it was designed fully as it ended up being implemented when i joined the team but so you borrow ideas and concepts and very concrete sort of local rules from different languages like the indentation and certain other syntactic features from abc but i chose to borrow string literals and how numbers work from c and various other things so in then if you take that further so yet youve had this funny sounding but i think surprisingly accurate and at least practical title of benevolent dictator for life for quite you know for the last three decades or whatever or no not the actual title but functionally speaking so you had to make decisions design decisions can you maybe lets take python 2 so releasing python 3 as an example its not backward compatible to python 2 in ways that a lot of people know so what was that deliberation discussion decision like yeah what was the psychology of that experience do you regret any aspects of how that experience undergone that well yeah so it was a group process really at that point even though i was bdfl in name and certainly everybody sort of respected my position as the creator and the current sort of owner of the language design i was looking at everyone else for feedback sort of python 30 in some sense was sparked by other people in the community pointing out oh well there are a few issues that sort of bite users over and over can we do something about that and for python 3 we took a number of those python words as they were called at the time and we said can we try to sort of make small changes to the language that address those words and we had sort of in the past we had always taken backwards compatibility very seriously and so many python words in earlier versions had already been resolved because they could be resolved while maintaining backwards compatibility or sort of using a very gradual path of evolution of the language in a certain area and so we were stuck with a number of words that were widely recognized as problems not like roadblocks but nevertheless sort of things that some people trip over and you know that thats always the same thing that people trip over when they trip and we could not think of a backwards compatible way of resolving those issues but its still an option to not resolve the issues right and so yes for a long time we had sort of resigned ourselves to well okay the language is not going to be perfect in this way and that way and that way and we sort of certain of these i mean there are still plenty of things where you can say well that particular detail is better in java or in r or in visual basic or whatever and were okay with that because well we cant easily change it its not too bad we can do a little bit with user education or we can have a static analyzer or warnings in the parse or something but there were things where we thought well these are really problems that are not going away they are getting worse in the future we should do something about that but ultimately there is a decision to be made right so was that the toughest decision in the history of python you had to make as the benevolent dictator for life or if not what are there maybe even on the smaller scale what was the decision where you were really torn up about well the toughest decision was probably to resign all right lets go there hold on a second then let me just because in the interest of time too because i have a few cool questions for you and lets touch a really important one because it was quite dramatic and beautiful in certain kinds of ways in july this year three months ago you wrote now that pep 572 is done i dont ever want to have to fight so hard for a pep and find that so many people despise my decisions i would like to remove myself entirely from the decision process ill still be there for a while as an ordinary core developer and ill still be available to mentor people possibly more available but im basically giving myself a permanent vacation from being bdfl benevolent dictator for life and you all will be on your own first of all its almost shakespearean im not going to appoint a successor so what are you all going to do create a democracy anarchy a dictatorship a federation so that was a very dramatic and beautiful set of statements its almost its open ended nature called the community to create a future for python its just kind of a beautiful aspect to it so what and dramatic you know what was making that decision like what was on your heart on your mind stepping back now a few months later im glad you liked the writing because it was actually written pretty quickly it was literally something like after months and months of going around in circles i had finally approved pep572 which i had a big hand in its design although i didnt initiate it originally i sort of gave it a bunch of nudges in a direction that would be better for the language so sorry just to ask is async io thats the one or no pep572 was actually a small feature which is assignment expressions that had been there was just a lot of debate where a lot of people claimed that they knew what was pythonic and what was not pythonic and they knew that this was going to destroy the language this was like a violation of pythons most fundamental design philosophy and i thought that was all bullshit because i was in favor of it and i would think i know something about pythons design philosophy so i was really tired and also stressed of that thing and literally after sort of announcing i was going to accept it a certain wednesday evening i had finally sent the email its accepted i can just go implement it so i went to bed feeling really relieved thats behind me and i wake up thursday morning 7 am and i think well that was the last one thats going to be such a terrible debate and thats the last time that i let myself be so stressed out about a pep decision i should just resign ive been sort of thinking about retirement for half a decade ive been joking and sort of mentioning retirement sort of telling the community at some point in the future im going to retire dont take that fl part of my title too literally and i thought okay this is it im done i had the day off i wanted to have a good time with my wife we were going to a little beach town nearby and in i think maybe 15 20 minutes i wrote that thing that you just called shakespearean the funny thing is i didnt even realize what a monumental decision it was because five minutes later i read that link to my message back on twitter where people were already discussing on twitter guido resigned as the bdfl and i had posted it on an internal forum that i thought was only read by core developers so i thought i would at least have one day before the news would sort of get out the on your own aspects had also an element of quite it was quite a powerful element of the uncertainty that lies ahead but can you also just briefly talk about for example i play guitar as a hobby for fun and whenever i play people are super positive super friendly theyre like this is awesome this is great but sometimes i enter as an outside observer i enter the programming community and there seems to sometimes be camps on whatever the topic and the two camps the two or plus camps are often pretty harsh at criticizing the opposing camps as an onlooker i may be totally wrong on this but what do you think of this yeah holy wars are sort of a favorite activity in the programming community and what is the psychology behind that is that okay for a healthy community to have is that a productive force ultimately for the evolution of a language well if everybody is patting each other on the back and never telling the truth it would not be a good thing i think there is a middle ground where sort of being nasty to each other is not okay but there is a middle ground where there is healthy ongoing criticism and feedback that is very productive and you mean at every level you see that i mean someone proposes to fix a very small issue in a code base chances are that some reviewer will sort of respond by saying well actually you can do it better the other way when it comes to deciding on the future of the python core developer community we now have i think five or six competing proposals for a constitution so that future do you have a fear of that future do you have a hope for that future im very confident about that future by and large i think that the debate has been very healthy and productive and i actually when i wrote that resignation email i knew that python was in a very good spot and that the python core developer community the group of 50 or 100 people who sort of write or review most of the code that goes into python those people get along very well most of the time a large number of different areas of expertise are represented different levels of experience in the python core dev community different levels of experience completely outside it in software development in general large systems small systems embedded systems so i felt okay resigning because i knew that the community can really take care of itself and out of a grab bag of future feature developments let me ask if you can comment maybe on all very quickly concurrent programming parallel computing async io these are things that people have expressed hope complained about whatever have discussed on reddit async io so the parallelization in general packaging i was totally clueless on this i just used pip to install stuff but apparently theres pipenv poetry theres these dependency packaging systems that manage dependencies and so on theyre emerging and theres a lot of confusion about whats the right thing to use then also functional programming are we going to get more functional programming or not this kind of idea and of course the gil connected to the parallelization i suppose the global interpreter lock problem can you just comment on whichever you want to comment on well lets take the gil and parallelization and async io as one topic im not that hopeful that python will develop into a sort of high concurrency high parallelism language thats sort of the way the language is designed the way most users use the language the way the language is implemented all make that a pretty unlikely future so you think it might not even need to really the way people use it it might not be something that should be of great concern i think async io is a special case because it sort of allows overlapping io and only io and that is a sort of best practice of supporting very high throughput io many connections per second im not worried about that i think async io will evolve there are a couple of competing packages we have some very smart people who are sort of pushing us to make async io better parallel computing i think that python is not the language for that there are ways to work around it but you cant expect to write an algorithm in python and have a compiler automatically parallelize that what you can do is use a package like numpy and there are a bunch of other very powerful packages that sort of use all the cpus available because you tell the package heres the data heres the abstract operation to apply over it go at it and then were back in the c world those packages are themselves implemented usually in c thats where tensorflow and all these packages come in where they parallelize across gpus for example they take care of that for you in terms of packaging can you comment on the future of packaging in python packaging has always been my least favorite topic its a really tough problem because the os and the platform want to own packaging but their packaging solution is not specific to a language if you take linux there are two competing packaging solutions for linux or for unix in general but they all work across all languages several languages like node javascript ruby and python all have their own packaging solutions that only work within the ecosystem of that language what should you use that is a tough problem my own approach is i use the system packaging system to install python and i use the python packaging system then to install third party python packages thats what most people do ten years ago python packaging was really a terrible situation nowadays pip is the future there is a separate ecosystem for numerical and scientific python based on anaconda those two can live together i dont think there is a need for more than that thats packaging well at least for me thats where ive been extremely happy i didnt even know this was an issue until it was brought up in the interest of time let me sort of skip through a million other questions i have so i watched the five and a half hour oral history that youve done with the computer history museum and the nice thing about it it gave this because of the linear progression of the interview it gave this feeling of a life you know a life well lived with interesting things in it sort of a pretty i would say a good spend of this little existence we have on earth so outside of your family looking back what about this journey are you really proud of are there moments that stand out accomplishments ideas is it the creation of python itself that stands out as a thing that you look back and say damn i did pretty good there well i would say that python is definitely the best thing ive ever done and i wouldnt sort of say just the creation of python but the way i sort of raised python like a baby i didnt just conceive a child but i raised a child and now im setting the child free in the world and ive set up the child to sort of be able to take care of himself and im very proud of that and as the announcer of monty pythons flying circus used to say and now for something completely different do you have a favorite monty python moment or a moment in hitchhikers guide or any other literature show or movie that cracks you up when you think about it you can always play me the dead parrot sketch oh thats brilliant thats my favorite as well its pushing up the daisies okay greta thank you so much for talking with me today lex this has been a great conversation i felt i had so much understanding of what actually goes on inside a computer i knew how many bits of memory it had and how difficult it was to program and sort of i didnt believe at all that you could just build something intelligent out of that that would really sort of satisfy my definition of intelligence i think the most influential thing that i read in my early twenties was gödel escherbach that was about consciousness and that was a big eye opener in some sense in what sense so on your own brain did you at the time or do you now see your own brain as a computer or is there a total separation of the way so yeah youre very pragmatically practically know the limits of memory the limits of this sequential computing or weakly paralyzed computing and you just know what we have now and its hard to see how it creates but its also easy to see it was in the 40s 50s 60s and now at least similarities between the brain and our computers oh yeah i mean i totally believe that brains are computers in some sense i mean the rules they use to play by are pretty different from the rules we can sort of implement in our current hardware but i dont believe in like a separate thing that infuses us with intelligence or consciousness or any of that theres no soul ive been an atheist probably from when i was 10 years old just by thinking a bit about math and the universe and well my parents were atheists now i know that you could be an atheist and still believe that there is something sort of about intelligence or consciousness that cannot possibly emerge from a fixed set of rules i am not in that camp i totally see that sort of given how many millions of years evolution took its time dna is a particular machine that sort of encodes information and an unlimited amount of information in chemical form and has figured out a way to replicate itself i thought that that was maybe its 300 million years ago but i thought it was closer to half a billion years ago that thats sort of originated and it hasnt really changed that the sort of the structure of dna hasnt changed ever since that is like our binary code that we have in hardware i mean the basic programming language hasnt changed but maybe the programming itself obviously it did sort of it happened to be a set of rules that was good enough to sort of develop endless variability and sort of the idea of self replicating molecules competing with each other for resources and one type eventually sort of always taking over that happened before there were any fossils so we dont know how that exactly happened but i believe its clear that that did happen can you comment on consciousness and how you see it because i think well talk about programming quite a bit well talk about you know intelligence connecting to programming fundamentally but consciousness is this whole other thing do you think about it often as a developer of a programming language and as a human those are pretty sort of separate topics sort of my line of work working with programming does not involve anything that goes in the direction of developing intelligence or consciousness but sort of privately as an avid reader of popular science writing i have some thoughts which is mostly that i dont actually believe that consciousness is an all or nothing thing i have a feeling that and i forget what i read that influenced this but i feel that if you look at a cat or a dog or a mouse they have some form of intelligence if you look at a fish it has some form of intelligence and that evolution just took a long time but i feel that the sort of evolution of more and more intelligence that led to sort of the human form of intelligence followed the evolution of the senses especially the visual sense i mean there is an enormous amount of processing thats needed to interpret a scene and humans are still better at that than computers are and i have a feeling that there is a sort of the reason that like mammals in particular developed the levels of consciousness that they have and that eventually sort of going from intelligence to self awareness and consciousness has to do with sort of being a robot that has very highly developed senses has a lot of rich sensory information coming in so thats a really interesting thought that whatever that basic mechanism of dna whatever that basic building blocks of programming if you just add more abilities more high resolution sensors more sensors you just keep stacking those things on top that this basic programming in trying to survive develops very interesting things that start to us humans to appear like intelligence and consciousness as far as robots go i think that the self driving cars have that sort of the greatest opportunity of developing something like that because when i drive myself i dont just pay attention to the rules of the road i also look around and i get clues from that oh this is a shopping district oh heres an old lady crossing the street oh here is someone carrying a pile of mail theres a mailbox i bet you theyre going to cross the street to reach that mailbox and i slow down and i dont even think about that and so there is so much where you turn your observations into an understanding of what other consciousnesses are going to do or what other systems in the world are going to be oh that tree is going to fall i see sort of i see much more of i expect somehow that if anything is going to become unconscious its going to be the self driving car and not the network of a bazillion computers in a google or amazon data center that are all networked together to do whatever they do so in that sense so you actually highlight because thats what i work in thomas vehicles you highlight the big gap between what we currently cant do and what we truly need to be able to do to solve the problem under that formulation then consciousness and intelligence is something that basically a system should have in order to interact with us humans as opposed to some kind of abstract notion of a consciousness consciousness is something that you need to have to be able to empathize to be able to fear understand what the fear of death is all these aspects that are important for interacting with pedestrians you need to be able to do basic computation based on our human desires and thoughts and if you sort of yeah if you look at the dog the dog clearly knows i mean im not the dog owner but i have friends who have dogs the dogs clearly know what the humans around them are going to do or at least they have a model of what those humans are going to do and they learn some dogs know when youre going out and they want to go out with you theyre sad when you leave them alone they cry theyre afraid because they were mistreated when they were younger we dont assign sort of consciousness to dogs or at least not all that much but i also dont think they have none of that so i think its consciousness and intelligence are not all or nothing the spectrum is really interesting but in returning to programming languages and the way we think about building these kinds of things about building intelligence building consciousness building artificial beings so i think one of the exciting ideas came in the 17th century and with leibniz hobbes descartes where theres this feeling that you can convert all thought all reasoning all the thing that we find very special in our brains you can convert all of that into logic so you can formalize it formal reasoning and then once you formalize everything all of knowledge then you can just calculate and thats what were doing with our brains is were calculating so theres this whole idea that this is possible that this we can actually program but they werent aware of the concept of pattern matching in the sense that we are aware of it now they sort of thought they had discovered incredible bits of mathematics like newtons calculus and their sort of idealism their sort of extension of what they could do with logic and math sort of went along those lines and they thought theres like yeah logic theres like a bunch of rules and a bunch of input they didnt realize that how you recognize a face is not just a bunch of rules but is a shit ton of data plus a circuit that sort of interprets the visual clues and the context and everything else and somehow can massively parallel pattern match against stored rules i mean if i see you tomorrow here in front of the dropbox office i might recognize you even if im wearing a different shirt yeah but if i see you tomorrow in a coffee shop in belmont i might have no idea that it was you or on the beach or whatever i make those kind of mistakes myself all the time i see someone that i only know as like oh this person is a colleague of my wifes and then i see them at the movies and i didnt recognize them but do you see those you call it pattern matching do you see that rules is unable to encode that everything you see all the pieces of information you look around this room im wearing a black shirt i have a certain height im a human all these theres probably tens of thousands of facts you pick up moment by moment about this scene you take them for granted and you aggregate them together to understand the scene you dont think all of that could be encoded to where at the end of the day you can just put it all on the table and calculate i dont know what that means i mean yes in the sense that there is no actual magic there but there are enough layers of abstraction from the facts as they enter my eyes and my ears to the understanding of the scene that i dont think that ai has really covered enough of that distance its like if you take a human body and you realize its built out of atoms well that is a uselessly reductionist view right the body is built out of organs the organs are built out of cells the cells are built out of proteins the proteins are built out of amino acids the amino acids are built out of atoms and then you get to quantum mechanics so thats a very pragmatic view i mean obviously as an engineer i agree with that kind of view but you also have to consider the sam harris view of well intelligence is just information processing like you said you take in sensory information you do some stuff with it and you come up with actions that are intelligent that makes it sound so easy i dont know who sam harris is oh well its a philosopher so like this is how philosophers often think right and essentially thats what descartes was is wait a minute if there is like you said no magic so he basically says it doesnt appear like theres any magic but we know so little about it that it might as well be magic so just because we know that were made of atoms just because we know were made of organs the fact that we know very little how to get from the atoms to organs in a way thats recreatable means that you shouldnt get too excited just yet about the fact that you figured out that were made of atoms right and the same about taking facts as our sensory organs take them in and turning that into reasons and actions that sort of there are a lot of abstractions that we havent quite figured out how to deal with those i mean sometimes i dont know if i can go on a tangent or not so if i take a simple program that parses say i have a compiler that parses a program in a sense the input routine of that compiler of that parser is a sensing organ and it builds up a mighty complicated internal representation of the program it just saw it doesnt just have a linear sequence of bytes representing the text of the program anymore it has an abstract syntax tree and i dont know how many of your viewers or listeners are familiar with compiler technology but theres… fewer and fewer these days right thats also true probably people want to take a shortcut but theres sort of this abstraction is a data structure that the compiler then uses to produce outputs that is relevant like a translation of that program to machine code that can be executed by hardware and then that data structure gets thrown away when a fish or a fly sees sort of gets visual impulses im sure it also builds up some data structure and for the fly that may be very minimal a fly may have only a few i mean in the case of a flys brain i could imagine that there are few enough layers of abstraction that its not much more than when its darker here than it is here well it can sense motion because a fly sort of responds when you move your arm towards it so clearly its visual processing is intelligent well not intelligent but it has an abstraction for motion and we still have similar things in but much more complicated in our brains i mean otherwise you couldnt drive a car if you couldnt if you didnt have an incredibly good abstraction for motion yeah in some sense the same abstraction for motion is probably one of the primary sources of our of information for us we just know what to do i think we know what to do with that weve built up other abstractions on top we build much more complicated data structures based on that and we build more persistent data structures sort of after some processing some information sort of gets stored in our memory pretty much permanently and is available on recall i mean there are some things that you sort of youre conscious that youre remembering it like you give me your phone number i well at my age i have to write it down but i could imagine i could remember those seven numbers or ten digits and reproduce them in a while if i sort of repeat them to myself a few times so thats a fairly conscious form of memorization on the other hand how do i recognize your face i have no idea my brain has a whole bunch of specialized hardware that knows how to recognize faces i dont know how much of that is sort of coded in our dna and how much of that is trained over and over between the ages of zero and three but somehow our brains know how to do lots of things like that that are useful in our interactions with other humans without really being conscious of how its done anymore right so our actual day to day lives were operating at the very highest level of abstraction were just not even conscious of all the little details underlying it theres compilers on top of its like turtles on top of turtles or turtles all the way down theres compilers all the way down but thats essentially you say that theres no magic thats what i what i was trying to get at i think is with descartes started this whole train of saying that theres no magic i mean theres all this beforehand well didnt descartes also have the notion though that the soul and the body were fundamentally separate separate yeah i think he had to write in god in there for political reasons so i dont know actually im not a historian but theres notions in there that all of reasoning all of human thought can be formalized i think that continued in the 20th century with russell and with gadots incompleteness theorem this debate of what are the limits of the things that could be formalized thats where the turing machine came along and this exciting idea i mean underlying a lot of computing that you can do quite a lot with a computer you can encode a lot of the stuff were talking about in terms of recognizing faces and so on theoretically in an algorithm that can then run on a computer and in that context id like to ask programming in a philosophical way what does it mean to program a computer so you said you write a python program or compiled a c program that compiles to some byte code its forming layers youre programming a layer of abstraction thats higher how do you see programming in that context can it keep getting higher and higher levels of abstraction i think at some point the higher levels of abstraction will not be called programming and they will not resemble what we call programming at the moment there will not be source code i mean there will still be source code sort of at a lower level of the machine just like there are still molecules and electrons and sort of proteins in our brains but and so theres still programming and system administration and who knows what to keep the machine running but what the machine does is a different level of abstraction in a sense and as far as i understand the way that for the last decade or more people have made progress with things like facial recognition or the self driving cars is all by endless endless amounts of training data where at least as a lay person and i feel myself totally as a lay person in that field it looks like the researchers who publish the results dont necessarily know exactly how their algorithms work and i often get upset when i sort of read a sort of a fluff piece about facebook in the newspaper or social networks and they say well algorithms and thats like a totally different interpretation of the word algorithm because for me the way i was trained or what i learned when i was eight or ten years old an algorithm is a set of rules that you completely understand that can be mathematically analyzed and you can prove things you can like prove that aristotelian sieve produces all prime numbers and only prime numbers yeah so i dont know if you know who andrej karpathy is im afraid not so hes a head of ai at tesla now but he was at stanford before and he has this cheeky way of calling this concept software 20 so let me disentangle that for a second so kind of what youre referring to is the traditional the algorithm the concept of an algorithm something thats there its clear you can read it you understand it you can prove its functioning as kind of software 10 and what software 20 is is exactly what you described which is you have neural networks which is a type of machine learning that you feed a bunch of data and that neural network learns to do a function all you specify is the inputs and the outputs you want and you cant look inside you cant analyze it all you can do is train this function to map the inputs to the outputs by giving a lot of data and thats as programming becomes getting a lot of data thats what programming is well that would be programming 20 to programming 20 i wouldnt call that programming its just a different activity just like building organs out of cells is not called chemistry well so lets just step back and think sort of more generally of course but you know its like as a parent teaching your kids things can be called programming in that same sense thats how programming is being used youre providing them data examples use cases so imagine writing a function not by not with for loops and clearly readable text but more saying well heres a lot of examples of what this function should take and heres a lot of examples of when it takes those functions it should do this and then figure out the rest so thats the 20 concept and so the question i have for you is like its a very fuzzy way this is the reality of a lot of these pattern recognition systems and so on its a fuzzy way of quote unquote programming what do you think about this kind of world should it be called something totally different than programming if youre a software engineer does that mean youre designing systems that are very can be systematically tested evaluated they have a very specific specification and then this other fuzzy software 20 world machine learning world thats something else totally or is there some intermixing thats possible well the question is probably only being asked because we dont quite know what that software 20 actually is and i think there is a truism that every task that ai has tackled in the past at some point we realized how it was done and then it was no longer considered part of artificial intelligence because it was no longer necessary to use that term it was just oh now we know how to do this and a new field of science or engineering has been developed and i dont know if sort of every form of learning or sort of controlling computer systems should always be called programming so i dont know maybe im focused too much on the terminology but i expect that there just will be different concepts where people with sort of different education and a different model of what theyre trying to do will develop those concepts i guess if you could comment on another way to put this concept is i think the kind of functions that neural networks provide is things as opposed to being able to upfront prove that this should work for all cases you throw at it all youre able its the worst case analysis versus average case analysis all youre able to say is it seems on everything weve tested to work 999 of the time but we cant guarantee it and it fails in unexpected ways we cant even give you examples of how it fails in unexpected ways but its like really good most of the time is there no room for that in current ways we think about programming programming 10 is actually sort of getting to that point too where the sort of the ideal of a bug free program has been abandoned long ago by most software developers we only care about bugs that manifest themselves often enough to be annoying and were willing to take the occasional crash or outage or incorrect result for granted because we cant possibly we dont have enough programmers to make all the code bug free and it would be an incredibly tedious business and if you try to throw formal methods at it it becomes even more tedious so every once in a while the user clicks on a link and somehow they get an error and the average user doesnt panic they just click again and see if it works better the second time which often magically it does or they go up and they try some other way of performing their tasks so thats sort of an end to end recovery mechanism and inside systems there is all sorts of retries and timeouts and fallbacks and i imagine that that sort of biological systems are even more full of that because otherwise they wouldnt survive do you think programming should be taught and thought of as exactly what you just said i come from this kind of youre always denying that fact always in sort of basic programming education the sort of the programs youre having students write are so small and simple that if there is a bug you can always find it and fix it because the sort of programming as its being taught in some even elementary middle schools in high school introduction to programming classes in college typically its programming in the small very few classes sort of actually teach software engineering building large systems every summer here at dropbox we have a large number of interns every tech company on the west coast has the same thing these interns are always amazed because this is the first time in their life that they see what goes on in a really large software development environment everything theyve learned in college was almost always about a much smaller scale and somehow that difference in scale makes a qualitative difference in how you do things and how you think about it if you then take a few steps back into decades 70s and 80s when you were first thinking about python or just that world of programming languages did you ever think that there would be systems as large as underlying google facebook and dropbox did you when you were thinking about python i was actually always caught by surprise by sort of this yeah pretty much every stage of computing so maybe just because youve spoken in other interviews but i think the evolution of programming languages are fascinating and its especially because it leads from my perspective towards greater and greater degrees of intelligence i learned the first programming language i played with in russia was with the turtle logo logo yeah and if you look i just have a list of programming languages all of which ive now played with a little bit i mean theyre all beautiful in different ways from fortran cobalt lisp algol 60 basic logo again c as a few the object oriented came along in the 60s simula pascal smalltalk all of that leads theyre all the classics the classics yeah the classic hits right steam thats built on top of lisp on the database side sql c and all of that leads up to python pascal too and thats before python matlab these kind of different communities different languages so can you talk about that world i know that sort of python came out of abc which i actually never knew that language i just having researched this conversation went back to abc and it looks remarkably it has a lot of annoying qualities but underneath those like all caps and so on but underneath that theres elements of python that are quite theyre already there thats where i got all the good stuff all the good stuff so but in that world youre swimming these programming languages were you focused on just the good stuff in your specific circle or did you have a sense of what is everyone chasing you said that every programming language is built to scratch an itch were you aware of all the itches in the community and if not or if yes i mean what itch were you trying to scratch with python well im glad i wasnt aware of all the itches because i would probably not have been able to do anything i mean if youre trying to solve every problem at once youll solve nothing well yeah its too overwhelming and so i had a very very focused problem i wanted a programming language that sat somewhere in between shell scripting and c and now arguably there is like one is higher level one is lower level and python is sort of a language of an intermediate level although its still pretty much at the high level end i was thinking about much more about i want a tool that i can use to be more productive as a programmer in a very specific environment and i also had given myself a time budget for the development of the tool and that was sort of about three months for both the design like thinking through what are all the features of the language syntactically and semantically and how do i implement the whole pipeline from parsing the source code to executing it so i think both with the timeline and the goals it seems like productivity was at the core of it as a goal so like for me in the 90s and the first decade of the 21st century i was always doing machine learning ai programming for my research was always in c and then the other people who are a little more mechanical engineering electrical engineering are matlabby theyre a little bit more matlab focused those are the world and maybe a little bit java too but people who are more interested in emphasizing the object oriented nature of things so within the last 10 years or so especially with the oncoming of neural networks and these packages that are built on python to interface with neural networks i switched to python and its just ive noticed a significant boost that i cant exactly because i dont think about it but i cant exactly put into words why im just much much more productive just being able to get the job done much much faster so how do you think whatever that qualitative difference is i dont know if its quantitative it could be just a feeling i dont know if im actually more productive but how do you think about you probably are yeah well thats right i think theres elements let me just speak to one aspect that i think that was affecting my productivity is c was i really enjoyed creating performant code and creating a beautiful structure where everything that you know this kind of going into this especially with the newer and newer standards of templated programming of just really creating this beautiful formal structure that i found myself spending most of my time doing that as opposed to getting it parsing a file and extracting a few keywords or whatever the task was trying to do so what is it about python how do you think of productivity in general as you were designing it now sort of through the decades last three decades what do you think it means to be a productive programmer',\n",
       " 'the following is a conversation with jeff atwood he is the cofounder of stack overflow and stack exchange websites that are visited by millions of people every single day much like with wikipedia it is difficult to understate the impact on global knowledge and productivity that these networks of sites have created jeff is also the author of the famed blog coding horror and the founder of discourse an open source software project that seeks to improve the quality of our online community discussions this conversation is part of the mit course on artificial general intelligence and the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it subscribe on youtube itunes or your podcast provider of choice or simply connect with me on twitter at lex friedman spelled f r i d and now heres my conversation with jeff atwood having co created and managed for a few years the worlds largest community of programmers in stack overflow 10 years ago what do you think motivates most programmers is it fame fortune glory process of programming itself or is it the sense of belonging to a community its puzzles really i think its this idea of working on puzzles independently of other people and just solving a problem sort of like on your own almost although nobody really works alone in programming anymore but i will say theres an aspect of hiding yourself away and just beating on a problem until you solve it like brute force basically to me is what a lot of programming is the computers so fast that you can do things that would take forever for a human but you can just do them so many times and so often that you get the answer youre saying just the pure act of tinkering with the code is the thing that drives most problems the struggle balance within the joy of overcoming the brute force process of pain and suffering that eventually leads to something that actually works well datas fun too theres this thing called the shuffling problem the naive shuffle that most programmers write has a huge flaw and theres a lot of articles online about this because it can be really bad if youre a casino and you have an unsophisticated programmer writing your shuffle algorithm theres surprising ways to get this wrong but the neat thing is the way to figure that out is just to run your shuffle a bunch of times and see how many orientations of cards you get you should get an equal distribution of all the cards and with the naive method of shuffling if you just look at the data if you just brute force it and say ok i dont know whats going to happen you just write a program that does it a billion times and then see what the buckets look like of the data and the monty hall problem is another example of that where you have three doors and somebody gives you information about another door so the correct answer is you should always switch in the monty hall problem which is not intuitive and it freaks people out all the time but you can solve it with data if you write a program that does the monty hall game and then never switches then always switches just compare you would immediately see that you dont have to be smart you dont have to figure out the answer algorithmically you can just brute force it out with data and say well i know the answer is this because i ran the program a billion times and these are the data buckets that i got from it so empirically find it but whats the joy of that so for you for you personally outside of family what motivates you in this process well to be honest i dont really write a lot of code anymore what i do at discourse is managery stuff which i always despised as a programmer you think of managers as people who dont really do anything themselves but the weird thing about code is you realize that language is code the ability to direct other people lets you get more stuff done than you could by yourself anyway you said language is code language is code meaning communication with other humans yes it is you can think of it as a systematic so what is it like to be what makes before we get into programming what makes a good manager what makes a good leader well i think a leader its all about leading by example first of all sort of doing and being the things that you want to be now this can be kind of exhausting particularly when you have kids because you realize that your kids are watching you all the time even in ways that youve stopped seeing yourself the hardest person to see on the planet is really yourself its a lot easier to see other people and make judgments about them but yourself youre super biased you dont actually see yourself the way other people see you often youre very very hard on yourself in a way that other people really arent going to be so thats one of the insights is youve got to be really diligent about thinking am i behaving in a way that represents how i want other people to behave like leading through example theres a lot of examples of leaders that really mess this up like they make decisions that are like wow its a bad example for other people so i think leading by example is one the other one i believe is working really hard and i dont mean working exhaustively but showing a real passion for the problem not necessarily your solution to the problem but the problem itself is just one that you really believe in like with discourse for example the problem that were looking at which is my current project is how do you get people in groups to communicate in a way that doesnt break down into the howling of wolves how do you deal with trolling not like technical problems how do i get people to post paragraphs how do i get people to use bold how do i get people to use complete sentences although those are problems as well but how do i get people to get along with each other and then solve whatever problem it is they set out to solve or reach some consensus on discussion or just not hurt each other even maybe its a discussion that doesnt really matter but are people yelling at each other and why like thats not the purpose of this kind of communication so i would say leadership is about setting an example doing the things that represent what you want to be and making sure that youre actually doing those things and theres a trick to that too because the things you dont do also say a lot about what you are yeah so lets pause on that one so those two things are fascinating so how do you have as a leader that self awareness so you just said its really hard to be self aware so for you personally or maybe for other leaders youve seen or look up to how do you know both that the things youre doing are the wrong things to be doing the way you speak to others the way you behave and the things youre not doing how do you get that signal i think theres two aspects to that one is like processing feedback that youre getting so how do you get feedback well right so are you getting feedback right so one way we do it for example with discourse we have three cofounders and we periodically talk about decisions before we make them so its not like one person can make a mistake or like wow there can be misunderstandings things like that so its part of like group consensus of leadership is like its good to have i think systems where theres one leader and that leader has the rule of absolute law are just really dangerous in my experience for communities for example like if you have a community thats run by one person that one person makes all the decisions that persons gonna have a bad day something could happen to that person something theres a lot of variables so like first when you think about leadership have multiple people doing leadership and have them talk amongst each other so giving each other feedback about the decisions that theyre making and then when you do get feedback i think theres that little voice in your head right or your gut or wherever you wanna put it in your body i think that voice is really important like i think most people who have any kind of moral compass or like want to do most people want to do the right thing i do believe that i mean there might be a handful of sociopaths out there that dont but most people they want other people to think of them as a good person and why wouldnt you right like do you want people to despise you i mean thats just weird right so you have that little voice that sort of the angel and devil on your shoulder sort of talking to you about like what youre doing how youre doing how does it make you feel to make these decisions right and i think having some attunement to that voice is important but you said that voice also for i think this is a programmer situation too where sometimes the devil on the shoulder is a little too loud so youre a little too self critical for a lot of developers and especially when you have introverted personality how do you struggle with a self criticism or the criticism of others so one of the things of leadership is to do something thats potentially unpopular or where people doubt you and you still go through with the decision so whats that balance like i think you have to walk people through your decision making right like you have to this is where blogging is really important and communication is so important again code language is just another kind of code its like here is the program by which i arrived at the conclusion that im gonna reach right its one thing to say like this is a decision its final deal with it right thats not usually satisfying to people but if you say look weve been thinking about this problem for a while heres some stuff thats happened heres what we think is right heres our goals heres what we wanna achieve and weve looked at these options and we think this available options is the best option people will be like oh okay right maybe i dont totally agree with you but i can kind of see where youre coming from and i see its not just arbitrary decision delivered from a cloud of flames in the sky right its like a human trying to reach some kind of consensus about goals and their goals might be different than yours thats completely legit right but if youre making that clear its like oh well the reason we dont agree is because we have totally different goals right like how could we agree its not that youre a bad person its that we have radically different goals in mind when we started looking at this problem and the other one you said is passion so or hard work sorry well those are tied together in my mind lets say hard work and passion like for me like i just really love the problem discourse is setting out to solve because in a way its like theres a vision of the world where it all devolves into facebook basically owning everything and every aspect of human communication right and this has always been kind of a scary world for me first cause i dont i think facebook is really good at execution i got to compliment them theyre very competent in terms of what theyre doing but facebook has not much of a moral compass in terms of facebook cares about facebook really they dont really care about you and your problems what they care about is how big they can make facebook right is that you talking about the company or just the mechanism of how facebook works kind of both really right like and the idea with discourse the reason im so passionate about it is cause i believe every community should have the right to own themselves right like they should have their own software that they can run that belongs to them thats their space where they can set the rules and if they dont like it they can move to different hosting or you know whatever they need to happen can happen but like this idea of a company town where all human communication is implicitly owned by whatsapp instagram and facebook and its really disturbing too cause facebook is really smart like i said theyre great at execution buying in whatsapp and buying instagram were incredibly smart decisions and they also do this thing i dont know if you know but they have this vpn software that they give away for free on smartphones and it indirectly feeds all the data about the traffic back to facebook so they can see whats actually getting popular through the vpns right they have low level access to the network data because users have let them have that so so lets take a small pause here first of all discourse can you talk about can you lay out the land of all the different ways you can have communities so theres stack overflow that youve built theres discourse so stack overflow is kind of like a wiki wikipedia you talk about and its a very specific scalpel very focused so what is the purpose of discourse and maybe contrast that with facebook first of all say what is discourse yeah start from the beginning well let me start from the very beginning so stack overflow is a very structured wiki style q and a for programmers right and that was the problem we first worked on and when we started we thought it was discussions because we looked at like programming forums and other things but we quickly realized we were doing q and a which is a very narrow subset of human communication right sorry so when you started stack overflow you thought you didnt even know the q and a not really you didnt know it would be q and a well we didnt know we had an idea of like okay these are things that we see working online we had a goal right our goal was there was this site experts exchange with a very unfortunate name thank you for killing that site yeah i know right like a lot of people dont remember it anymore which is great like thats the measure of success when people dont remember the thing that you were trying to replace then youve totally won so it was a place to get answers to programming questions but it wasnt clear if it was like focused q and a if it was a discussion there were plenty of programming forums so we werent really sure we were like okay well take aspects of dig and reddit like voting were very important reordering answers based on votes wiki style stuff of like being able to edit posts not just your posts but other peoples posts to make them better and keep them more up to date ownership of blogging of like okay this is me im saying this in my voice this is the stuff that i know and your reputation accrues to you and its peer recognition so you asked earlier like what motivates programmers i think peer recognition motivates them a lot that was one of the key insights of stack overflow was like recognition from your peers is why things get done not necessarily money not necessarily your boss but like your peers saying wow this person really knows their stuff has a lot of value so the reputation system came from that so we were sort of frankensteining a bunch of stuff together in stack overflow like stuff we had seen working and we knew worked and that became stack overflow over time we realized it wasnt really discussion it was very focused questions and answers there wasnt a lot of room on the page for let me talk about this tangential thing it was more like okay is it answering the question is it clarifying the question or could it be an alternative answer to the same question because theres usually more than one way to do it in programming theres like say five to 10 ways and one of the patterns we got into early on with stack overflow was there were questions where there would be like hundreds of answers and were like wow how can there be a programming question with 500 200 500 answers and we looked at those and we realized those were not really questions in the traditional sense they were discussions it was stuff that we allowed early on that we eventually decided wasnt allowed such as whats your favorite programming food whats the funniest programming cartoon youve seen and we had to sort of backfill a bunch of rules about like why isnt this allowed such as is this a real problem youre facing like nobody goes to work and says wow i cant work cause i dont know what the funniest programming cartoon is so sorry cant compile this code now right its not a real problem youre facing in your job so that was run rule and the second like what can you really learn from that its like what i call accidental learning or reddit style learning where youre just like oh ill just browse some things and oh wow you know did you know tree frogs only live three years i mean i just made that up i dont know if thats true but i didnt really set out to learn that i dont need to know that right its accidental learning it was more intentional learning where youre like okay i have a problem and i want to learn about stuff around this problem having right and it could be theory it could be compiler theory it could be other stuff but im having a compiler problem hence i need to know the compiler theory that aspect of it that gets me to my answer right so kind of a directed learning so we had to backfill all these rules as we sort of figured out what the heck it was we were doing and the system came very strict over time and a lot of people still complain about that and i wrote my latest blog entry what does stack overflow want to be when it grows up celebrating the 10 year anniversary yeah yeah so 10 years and the system has trended towards strictness theres a variety of reasons for this one is people dont like to see other people get reputation for stuff as they view as frivolous which i can actually understand because if you saw a programmer got like 500 upvotes for funniest programming cartoon or funniest comment they had seen in code its like well why do they have that reputation is it because they wrote the joke probably not i mean if they did maybe or the cartoon right theyre getting a bunch of reputation based on someone elses work thats not even programming its just a joke right its related to programming so you begin to resent that youre like well thats not fair and it isnt at some level theyre correct i mean i empathize because its not correct to get reputation for that versus heres a really gnarly regular expression problem and heres a really clever insightful detailed answer laying out oh heres why youre seeing the behavior that youre seeing here let me teach you some things about how to avoid that in the future thats great thats gold right you want people to get reputation for that not so much for wow look at this funny thing i saw right great so theres this very specific qa format and then take me through the journey towards discourse and facebook and twitter so you started at the beginning that stack overflow evolved to have a purpose so what is discourse this passion you have for creating community for discussion when was that born and how well part of it is based on the realization that stack overflow is only good for very specific subjects where its based on data facts and science where answers can be kind of verified to be true another form of that is theres the book of knowledge like the tome of knowledge that defines whatever it is you can refer to that book and itll give you the answer there has to be it only works on subjects where theres like semi clear answers to things that can be verified in some form now again theres always more than one way to do it theres complete flexibility and system around that but where it falls down is stuff like poker and lego like we had if you go to stackexchangecom we have an engine that tries to launch different qa topics right and people can propose qa topics sample questions and if it gets enough support within the network we launched that qa site so some of the ones we launched were poker and lego and they did horribly right because i mean they might still be there lingering on in some form but it was an experiment this is like a test right and some subjects work super well on the stack engine and some dont but the reason lego and poker dont work is because theyre so social really its not about whats the rule here in poker its like well what kind of cigars do we like to smoke while playing poker or whats a cool set of cards to use when im playing poker or whats some strategies say i have this hand come up with some strategies i could use its more of a discussion around whats happening with lego same thing heres this cool lego set i found look how awesome this is and im like yeah thats freaking awesome right its not a question right theres all these social components and discussions that dont fit at all we literally have to disallow those in stack overflow because its not about being social its about problems that youre facing in your work that you need concrete answers for you have a real demonstrated problem thats blocking you in something nobodys blocked by what should i do when i have a straight flush its not a blocking problem in the world its just an opportunity to hang out and discuss so discourse was a way to address that and say look discussion forum software was very very bad and when i came out of stack overflow in early 2012 it was still very very bad i expected it improved in the four years since i last looked but it had not improved at all and i was like well thats kind of terrible because i love these communities of people talking about things that they love theyre just communities of interest right and theres no good software for them startups would come to me and say hey jeff i want to have this startup heres my idea and the first thing i would say to them is well first why are you asking me i dont really know your field necessarily why arent you asking the community the people that are interested in this problem the people that are using your product why arent you talking to them and then theyd say oh great idea how do i do that and then thats when i started playing sad trombone because i realized all the software involving talking to your users customers audience patrons whatever it is it was all really bad it was stuff that i would be embarrassed to recommend to other people and yet thats where i felt they could get the biggest and strongest most effective input for what they should be doing with their product right its from their users from their community right thats what we did on stack overflow so what were talking about with forums the what is it the dark matter of the internet its still i dont know if its still but for the longest time it has some of the most passionate and fascinating discussions and whats the usual structure theres usually its linear so its sequential so youre posting one after the other and theres pagination so its every theres 10 posts and then you go to the next page and that format still is used by like im were doing a lot of research with tesla vehicles and theres a tesla motors club forum which is extremely we really wanted to run that actually they pinged us about it i dont think we got it but i really would have liked to gotten that one but theyve started before even 2012 i believe its like you dont want a heartbeat thats like so fast its like youre just freaking out but it is a measure of health you should have a healthy heartbeat its up to people listening to decide what that means but it has to be healthy it has to be reasonable because otherwise youre just going to be frustrated because thats how you build software you make mistakes you roll it out you live with it you see what it feels like and say oh god that was a terrible idea oh my gosh this could be even better if we did y right you turn the crank and then the more you do that the faster you get ahead of your competitors ultimately its rate of change right delta v right how fast are you moving well within a year youre going to be miles away by the time they catch up with you right thats the way it works and plus as a software developer and user i love software thats constantly changing because i dont understand people who get super pissed off when like oh they changed the software on me how dare they im like yes change the software change it all the time man thats what makes this stuff great is that it can be changed so rapidly and become something that is greater than it is now now granted there are some changes that suck i admit ive seen it many times but in general thats what makes software cool right its that it is so malleable fighting that is weird to me because its like well youre fighting the essence of the thing that youre building that doesnt make sense you want to really embrace that not to be a hummingbird but embrace it to a healthy cycle of your heartbeat right so you talk about that people really dont change its true thats why probably a lot of the stuff you write about in your blog probably will remain true well theres a flip side of the coin people dont change like investing and understanding people is like learning unix in 1970 because nothing has changed right all those things youve learned about people will still be valid 34 years from now whereas if you learn the latest javascript framework thats going to be good for like two years right exactly but if you look at the future of programming so theres a people component but theres also the technology itself what do you see as the future of programming will it change significantly or as far as you can tell people are ultimately programming and so its not something that you foresee changing in any fundamental way well youve got to go look back on sort of the basics of programming and one of things that always shocked me is like source control like i didnt learn anything about source control granted i graduated from college in 1992 but i remember hearing from people as late as like 1998 1999 like even maybe today theyre not learning source control and to me its like well how can you not learn source control that is so fundamental to working with other programmers working in a way that you dont lose your work just basic software the literal bedrock of software development is source control now you compare it today like github right like microsoft bought github which i think was an incredibly smart acquisition move on their part now they have anybody who wants reasonable source control to go sign up on github its all set up for you right theres tons of walkthroughs tons of tutorials so from the concept of like has programming advanced from say 1999 its like well hell we have github i mean my god yes right like its massively advanced over what it was now as to whether programming is significantly different im going to say no but i think the baseline of what we view as fundamentals will continue to go up and actually get better like source control thats one of the fundamentals that has gotten hundreds of orders of magnitude better than it was 10 20 years ago so those are the fundamentals let me introduce two things that maybe you can comment on so one is mobile phones so that could fundamentally transform what programming is or maybe not maybe you can comment on that and the other one is artificial intelligence which promises to in some ways to do some of the programming for you is one way to think about it so its really what a programmer is is using the intelligence thats inside your skull to do something useful the hope with artificial intelligence is that it does some of the useful parts for you where you dont have to think about it so do you see smartphones the fact that everybody has one and theyre getting more and more powerful as potentially changing programming and do you see ai as potentially changing programming ok so thats good so smartphones have definitely changed i mean since i guess 2010 is when they really started getting super popular i mean in the last eight years the world has literally changed right everybody carries a computer around and thats normal i mean that is such a huge change in society i think were still dealing with a lot of the positive and negative ramifications of that right everybodys connected all the time everybodys on the computer all the time that was my dream world as a geek right but its like be careful what you ask for right like wow now everybody has a computer its not quite the utopia that we thought it would be right computers can be used for a lot of stuff thats not necessarily great so to me thats the central focus of the smartphone is just that it puts a computer in front of everyone granted a small touch screen smallish touch screen computer but as for programming i dont know i dont think that ive kind of over time come to subscribe to the unix view of the world when it comes to programming you want to teach these basic command line things and that is just what programming is going to be for i think a long long time i dont think theres any magical visual programming thats going to happen i dont know ive over time have become a believer in that unix philosophy of just you know they kind of had to write with unix thats going to be the way it is for a long long time and well continue to like i said raise the baseline the tools will get better itll get simpler but its still fundamentally going to be command line tools fancy ides thats kind of it for the foreseeable future im not seeing any visual programming stuff on the horizon because you kind of think like what do you do on a smartphone that will be directly analogous to programming like im trying to think right and theres really not much so not necessarily analogous to programming but the kind of things that the kind of programs you would need to write might need to be very different yeah and the kind of languages i mean but i probably also subscribe to the same just because everything in this world might be written in javascript oh yeah thats already happening i mean discourse is a bet discourse itself javascript is another bet on that side of the table and i still try and believe in that so i would say smartphones have mostly a cultural shift more than a programming shift now your other question was about artificial intelligence and sort of devices predicting what youre going to do and i do think theres some strength to that i think artificial intelligence is kind of overselling it in terms of what its doing its more like people are predictable right people do the same things let me give you an example one check we put in a discourse thats been a lot of big commercial websites is say you log in from new york city now and then an hour later you log in from san francisco its like well hmm thats interesting how did you get from new york to san francisco in one hour so at that point youre like ok this is a suspicious login at that point so we would alert you its like ok but thats not ai right thats just a heuristic of like how did you in one hour get 2000 miles right that doesnt i mean youre grand maybe youre on a vpn theres other ways to happen thats just a basic prediction based on the idea that people pretty much dont move around that much they may travel occasionally but nobody unless youre a traveling salesman thats literally traveling the world every day theres so much repetition and predictability in terms of things youre going to do and i think good software anticipates your needs for example google i think its called google now or whatever that google thing is that predicts your commute and predicts based on your phone location where are you every day well thats probably where you work that kind of stuff i do think computers can get a lot better at that i hesitate to call it full blown ai its just computers getting better at like first of all they have a ton of data because everybody has a smartphone now all of a sudden we have all this data that we didnt have before about location about communication and feeding that into some basic heuristics and maybe some fancy algorithms that turn it into predictions of anticipating your needs like a friend would right like oh hey i see your home would you like some dinner right like lets go get some food because thats usually what we do at this time of day right in the context of actually the act of programming do you see ides improving and making the life of programming as better i do think that is possible because theres a lot of repetition in programming right oh you know clippy would be the bad example of oh i see it looks like youre writing a for loop but there are patterns in code right and actually libraries are kind of like that right rather than go code up your own http request library its like well youd use one of the existing ones that we have thats already a troubleshot right its not ai per se its just building better lego bricks bigger lego bricks that have more functionality in them so people dont have to worry about the low level stuff as much anymore like wordpress for example to me is like a tool for somebody who isnt a programmer to do something i mean you can turn wordpress into anything its kind of crazy actually through plugins right and thats not programming per se its just lego bricks stacking wordpress elements right and a little bit of configuration glue so i would say maybe in a broader sense what im seeing like therell be more gluing and less actual programming and thats a good thing right because most of the stuff you need is kind of out there already you said 1970s unix do you see php and these kind of old remnants of the early birth of programming remaining with us for a long time like you said unix in itself do you see ultimately this stuff just being there out of momentum i kind of do i mean i was a big believer in windows early on and i was a big you know i was like unix what a waste of time but over time ive completely flipped on that where i was like okay the unix guys were right and pretty much microsoft and windows were kind of wrong at least on the server side now on the desktop right you need a gui you need all that stuff and you have the two philosophies like apple built on unix effectively darwin and on the desktop its a slightly different story but on the server side where youre gonna be programming now its a question of where the programmings gonna be theres gonna be a lot more like client side programming because technically discourse is client side programming the way you get discourse we deliver a big ball of javascript which is then executed locally so were really using a lot more local computing power well still retrieve the data obviously we have to display the posts on the screen and so forth but in terms of like sorting and a lot of the basic stuff were using the host processor but to the extent that a lot of programming is still gonna be server side i would say yeah the unix philosophy definitely won and therell be different veneers over unix but its still if you peel away one or two layers its gonna be unixy for a long i think unix won i mean so definitively its interesting to hear you say that because youve done so much excellent work on the microsoft side in terms of backend development cool so whats the future hold for jeff atwood i mean the discourse continuing the discourse in trying to improve conversation on the web well discourse is what ive viewed as a and originally i called it a five year project then really quickly revised that to a 10 year project so we started in early 2013 thats when we launched the first version so were still five years in this is the part where it starts getting good like we have a good product now discourse theres any project you build in software it takes three years to build what you want it to build anyway like v1 is gonna be terrible which it was but you ship it anyway because thats how you get better at stuff its about turning the crank its not about v1 being perfect because thats ridiculous its about v1 then lets get really good at v11 12 13 like how fast can we iterate and i think were iterating like crazy on discourse to the point that like its a really good product now we have serious momentum and my original vision was i wanna be the wordpress of discussion meaning someone came to you and said i wanna start a blog although the very question is kind of archaic now its like who actually blogs anymore but i wanted the answer to that to be it would be wordpress normally because thats the obvious choice for blogging most of the time but if someone said hey i need a group of people to get together and do something the answer should be discourse right that should be the default answer for people because its open source its free doesnt cost you anything you control it you can run it your minimum server cost for discourse is five bucks a month at this point they actually got the vps prices down it used to be 10 a month for one gigabyte of ram which we have a kind of heavy stack like theres a lot of stuff in discourse you need postgres you need redis you need ruby and rails you need a sidekick for scheduling its not a trivial amount of stuff because we were architected for like look were building for the next 10 years i dont care about shared php hosting thats not my model my idea is like hey eventually this is gonna be very cheap for everybody and i wanna build it right using again higher bigger building block levels right that have more requirements and theres a wordpress model of wordpressorg wordpresscom is there a central hosting for discourse or no there is were not strictly segmenting into the open source versus the commercial side we have a hosting business thats how discourse makes money is we host discourse instances and we have really close relationship with our customers of the symbiosis of them giving us feedback on the product we definitely wait feedback from customers a lot heavier than feedback from somebody who just wanders by and gives feedback but thats where we make all our money but we dont have a strict division we encourage people to use discourse like the whole point is that its free right anybody can set it up i dont wanna be the only person that hosts discourse thats absolutely not the goal but it is a primary way for us to build a business and its actually kind of a great business i mean the business is going really really well in terms of hosting so i used to work at google research its a company thats basically funded on advertisements so its facebook let me ask if you can comment on it i think advertisement is best so youd be extremely critical on what ads are but at its best its actually serving you in a sense its giving you its connecting you to what you would want to explore so its like related posts or related content its the same thats the best of advertisement so discourse is connecting people based on their interests it seems like a place where advertisement at its best could actually serve the users is that something that youre considering thinking about as a way to bring to financially support the platform thats interesting because i actually have a contrarian view of advertising which i kind of agree with you i recently installed adblocker reluctantly because i dont like to do that but the performance of the ads man theyre so heavy now and its just crazy so its almost like a performance argument more than like i actually am pro ads and i have a contrarian viewpoint i agree with you if you do ads right its serving you stuff you would be interested in anyway i dont mind that that actually is kind of a good thing so plus i think its rational to wanna support the people that are doing this work through seeing their ads but that said i run adblock now which i didnt wanna do but i was convinced by all these articles like 30 40 megabytes of stuff just to serve you ads yeah it feels like ads now are like the experts exchange of whenever you start a stock overflow its a little bit its overwhelming oh theres so many companies in ad tech that its embarrassing like you can do that have you seen those logo charts of like just the whole page its like you cant even see them theyre so small theres so many companies in the space but since you brought it up i do wanna point out that very very few discourse sites actually run using an ad supported model its not effective like its too diluted its too weird it doesnt pay well and like users hate it so its a combination of like users hate it it doesnt actually work that well in practice like in theory yes i agree with you if you had clean fast ads that were exactly the stuff you would be interested in awesome were so far from that though right like and google does an okay job they do retargeting and stuff like that but in the real world discourse sites rarely can make ads work it just doesnt work for so many reasons but you know what does work is subscriptions patreon affiliate codes for like amazon of like just oh heres a cool yo yo click and then you click and go to amazon they get a small percentage of that which is fair i think i mean because you saw the yo yo on that site and you clicked through and you bought it right thats fair for them to get 5 of that or 2 of that whatever it is those things definitely work in fact a site that i used to participate on a lot i helped the owner one of the things i got them to switch to discourse i basically paid them to switch to discourse because i was like look you guys got to switch i cant come here anymore on this terrible software but i was like look and on top of that like youre serving people ads that they hate like you should just go full on patreon because he had a little bit of patreon go full on patreon do the amazon affiliates thing for any amazon links that get posted and just do that and just triple down on that stuff and thats worked really well for them and this creator in particular so that stuff works but traditional ads i mean definitely not working at least on discourse so last question youve created the code keyboard ive programmed most of my adult life on a kinesis keyboard i have one upstairs now can you describe what a mechanical keyboard is and why is it something that makes you happy well you know this is another fetish item really like its not required you can do programming on any kind of keyboard even like an onscreen keyboard oh god thats terrifying but you could i mean if you look back at the early days of computing there were chiclet keyboards which are awful but whats a chiclet keyboard oh god ok well its just like thin rubber membranes oh the rubber ones oh no super bad right so its a fetish item all that really says is look i care really about keyboards because the keyboard is the primary method of communication with the computer so its just like having a nice mic for this podcast you want a nice keyboard right because it has a very tactile feel i can tell exactly when i press the key i get that little click so oh and it feels good and its also kind of a fetish item its like wow i care enough about programming that i care about the tool the primary tool that i use to communicate with the computer make sure its as good as it feels good to use for me and i can be very productive with it so to be honest its a little bit of a fetish item but a good one it indicates that youre serious it indicates youre interested it indicates that you care about the fundamentals because you know what makes you a good programmer being able to type really fast right this is true right so a core skill is just being able to type fast enough to get your ideas out of your head into the code base so just practicing your typing can make you a better programmer it is also something that makes you well makes you enjoy typing correct the actual act something about the process like i play piano its tactile theres a tactile feel that ultimately feeds the passion makes you happy right no totally thats it i mean and its funny because artisanal keyboards have exploded like massdrop has gone ballistic with this stuff theres probably like 500 keyboard projects on massdrop alone and theres some other guy i follow on twitter i used to write for the site the tech report way back in the day and hes like every week hes just posting what i call keyboard porn of just cool keyboards like oh my god those look really cool right its like how many keyboards does this guy have right its kind of like me with yo yos how many yo yos do you have how many do you need well technically one but i like a lot i dont know why so same thing with keyboards so yeah theyre awesome like i highly recommend anybody that doesnt have a mechanical to research it look into it and see what you like and its ultimately a fetish item but i think these sort of items these religious artifacts that we have are part of what make us human like that parts important right its kind of what makes life worth living yeah its not necessary in the strictest sense but aint nothing necessary if you think about it right like so yeah why not so sure jeff thank you so much for talking today yeah youre welcome thanks for having me i mean theyve been running for a long time its still an extremely rich source of information so whats broken about that system and how are you trying to fix it i think theres a lot of power in connecting people that love the same stuff around that specific topic meaning facebooks idea of connection is just any human thats related to another human right like through friendship or any other reason facebooks idea of the world is sort of the status update right like a friend of yours did something ate at a restaurant right whereas discussion forums were traditionally around the interest graph like i love electric cars specifically i love tesla right like i love the way they approach the problem i love the style of the founder i just love the design ethic and theres a lot to like about tesla i dont know if you saw the oatmeal he did a whole love comic to tesla and it was actually kind of cool because i learned some stuff he was talking about how great tesla cars were specifically like how they were built differently and he went into a lot of great detail that was really interesting and to me that oatmeal post if you read it is the genesis of pretty much all interest communities i just really love this stuff so like for me for example theres yo yos right like im into the yo yo communities and these interest communities are just really fascinating to me and i feel more connected to the yo yo communities than i do to friends that i dont see that often right like to me the powerful thing is the interest graph and facebook kind of dabbles in the interest graph i mean they have groups you can sign up for groups and stuff but its really about the relationship graph like this is my coworker this is my relative this is my friend but not so much about the interest so i think thats the linchpin of which forums and communities are built on that i personally love like i said leadership is about passion right and being passionate about stuff is a really valid way to look at the world and i think its a way a lot of stuff in the world gets done like i once had someone describe me as hes like jeff youre a guy who you just get super passionate about a few things at a time and you just go super deep in those things and i was like oh thats kind of right thats kind of what i do i get into something and just be super into that for a couple of years or whatever and just learn all i can about it and go super deep in it and thats how i enjoy experiencing the world right like not being shallow on a bunch of things but being really deep on a few things that im interested in so forums kind of unlock that right and you dont want a world where everything belongs to facebook at least i dont i want a world where communities can kind of own themselves set their own norms set their own rules control the experience because community is also about ownership right like if youre meeting at the barnes and noble every thursday and barnes and noble says get out of here you guys dont buy enough books well you know youre kind of hosed right barnes and noble owns you right like you cant but if you have your own meeting space you know your own clubhouse you can set your own rules decide what you want to talk about there and just really generate a lot better information than you could like hanging out at barnes and noble every thursday at 3 pm right so thats kind of the vision of discourse is a place where its fully open source you can take the software you can install it anywhere and you know you and a group of people can go deep on whatever it is that youre into and this works for startups right startups are a group of people who go super deep on a specific problem right and they want to talk to the community its like well install discourse right thats what we do at discourse thats what i did at stack overflow i spent a lot of time on meta stack overflow which is our internal well public community feedback site and just experiencing what the users were experiencing right because theyre the ones doing all the work in the system and they had a lot of interesting feedback and theres that 90 10 rule of like 90 of the feedback you get is not really actionable for a variety of reasons it might be bad feedback it might be crazy feedback it might be feedback you just cant act on right now but theres 10 of it thats like gold its like literally gold and diamonds where its like feedback of really good improvements to your core product that are not super hard to get to and actually make a lot of sense and my favorite is about 5 of those stuff i didnt even see coming its like oh my god i never even thought of that but thats a brilliant idea right and i can point to so many features of stack overflow that we derive from meta stack overflow feedback and meta discourse right same exact principle of discourse you know were getting ideas from the community i was like oh my god i never thought of that but thats fantastic right like i love that relationship with the community from having built these communities what have you learned about whats the process of getting a critical mass of members in a community is it luck skill timing persistence what is is it the tools like discourse that empower that community whats the key aspect of starting for one guy or gal and then building it to two and then 10 and a hundred and a thousand and so on i think when youre starting with an n of one i mean i think its persistence and also you have to be interesting like somebody i really admire once said something that i always liked about blogging hes like heres how you blog you have to have something interesting to say and have an interesting way of saying it right and then do that for like 10 years so thats the genesis is like you have to have sort of something interesting to say thats not exactly what everybody else is saying and an interesting way of saying it which is another way of saying kind of entertaining way of saying it and then as far as growing it its like ritual you know like you have to like say youre starting a blog you have to say look im gonna blog every week three times a week and you have to stick to that schedule right because until you do that for like several years youre never gonna get anywhere like it just takes years to get to where you need to get to and part of that is having the discipline to stick with the schedule and it helps again if its something youre passionate about this wont feel like work youre like i love this i could talk about this all day every day right you just have to do it in a way thats interesting to other people and then as youre growing the community that pattern of participation within the community of like generating these artifacts and inviting other people to help you like collaborate on these artifacts like even in the case of blogging like i felt in the early days of my blog which i started in 2004 which is really the genesis of stack overflow if you look at all my blog it leads up to stack overflow which was i have all this energy in my blog but i dont like 40000 people were subscribing to me and i was like i wanna do something and then i met joel and said hey joel i wanna do something take this ball of energy from my blog and do something and all the people reading my blog saw that its like oh cool youre involving us youre saying look youre part of this community lets build this thing together like they pick the name like we voted on the name for stack overflow on my blog like we came up and naming is super hard first of all the hardest problem in computer science is coming up with a good name for stuff right but you can go back to my blog theres the poll where we voted and stack overflow became the name of the site and all the early beta users of stack overflow were audience of my blog plus joels blog right so we started from like if you look at the genesis okay i was just a programmer who said hey i love programming but i have no outlet to talk about it so im just gonna blog about it because i dont have enough people to work to talk to about it because at the time i worked a place where you know programming wasnt the core output of the company it was a pharmaceutical company and i just love this stuff you know to an absurd degree so i was like ill just blog about it and then ill find an audience and eventually found an audience eventually found joel and eventually built stack overflow from that one core of activity right but it was that repetition of feeding back in feedback from my blog comments feedback from joel feedback from the early stack overflow community when people see that youre doing that they will follow along with you right theyll say cool youre here in good faith youre actually you know not listening to everything because thats impossible thats impossible but youre actually you know waiting our feedback and what youre doing and why wouldnt i because who does all the work on stack overflow me joel no its the other programmers that are doing all the work so you gotta have some respect for that and then you know discipline around look you know were trying to do a very specific thing here on stack overflow were not trying to solve all the worlds problems were trying to solve this very specific q and a problem in a very specific way not cause were jerks about it but because these strict set of rules help us get really good results right and programmers thats an easy sell for the most part because programmers are used to dealing with ridiculous systems of rules like constantly thats basically their job so theyre very oh yeah super strict system of rules that lets me get what i want thats programming right thats what stack overflow is so so youre making it sound easy but in 2004 lets go back there in 2004 you started the blog coding horror was it called that at the very beginning it was one of the smart things i did its from a book by steve mcconnell code complete which is one of my favorite programming books still probably my number one programming book for anyone to read so one of the smart things i did back then i dont always do smart things when i start stuff i contacted steve and said hey i really like this it was a sidebar illustration indicating danger in code right coding horror was like watch out and i love that illustration because it spoke to me because i saw that illustration go oh my god thats me like im always my own worst enemy like thats the key insight in programming is every time you write something think how am i gonna screw myself because you will constantly right so that icon was like oh yeah i need to constantly hold that mirror up and look and say look youre very fallible youre gonna screw this up like how can you build this in such a way that youre not gonna screw it up later like how can you get that discipline around making sure at every step im thinking through all the things that i could do wrong or that other people could do wrong because that is actually how you get to be a better programmer a lot of times right so that sidebar illustration i loved it so much and i wrote steve before i started my blog and said hey can i have permission to use this because i just really like this illustration and steve was kind enough to give me permission to do that and just continues to give me permission so yeah really thats awesome but in 2004 you started this blog you know you look at stephen king his book on writing or stephen pressfield war of art book i mean it seems like writers suffer i mean its a hard process of writing right theres gonna be suffering i mean i wont kid you well the work is suffering right like doing the work like even when youre every week youre like okay that blog post wasnt very good or people didnt like it or people said disparaging things about it you have to like have the attitude like you know no matter what happens i wanna do this for me right its not about you its about me i mean in the end it is about everyone because this is how good work gets out into the world but you have to be pretty strict about saying like you know im selfish in the sense that i have to do this for me you know you mentioned stephen king like his book on writing but like one of the things i do for example when writing is like i read it out loud one of the best pieces of advice for writing anything is read it out loud like multiple times and make it sound like youre talking because that is the goal of good writing it should sound like you said it with slightly better phrasing because you have more time to think about what youre saying but like it should sound natural when you say it and i think thats probably the single best writing advice i can give anyone just read it over and over out loud make sure it sounds like something you would normally say and it sounds good and whats your process of writing see theres usually a pretty good idea behind the blog post so ideas right so i think you gotta have the concept that theres so many interesting things in the world like i mean my god the world is amazing right like you can never write about everything thats going on because its so incredible but if you cant come up with like lets say one interesting thing per day to talk about then youre not trying hard enough because the world is full of just super interesting stuff and one great way to like mine stuff is go back to old books cause they bring up old stuff thats still super relevant and i did that a lot cause i was like reading classic programming books and a lot of the early blog posts were like oh i was reading this programming book and they brought this really cool concept and i wanna talk about it some more and you get the i mean youre not claiming credit for the idea but it gives you something interesting to talk about thats kind of evergreen right like you dont have to go what should i talk about so well just go dig up some old classic programming books and find something that oh wow thats interesting or how does that apply today or what about x and y or compare these two concepts so pull a couple of sentences from that book and then sort of play off of it almost agree or disagree so in 2007 you wrote that you were offered a significant amount of money to sell the blog you chose not to what were all the elements you were thinking about cause id like to take you back it seems like theres a lot of nonlinear decisions you made through life so what was that decision like right so one of the things i love is the choose your own adventure books which i loved as a kid and i feel like theyre early programmer books cause theyre all about if then statements right if this then this and theyre also very very unforgiving like theres all these sites that map the classic choose your own adventure books and how many outcomes are bad a lot of bad outcomes so part of the game is like oh i got a bad outcome go back one step go back one further step its like how did i get here right like its a sequence of decisions and this is true of life right like every decision is a sequence right individually any individual decision is not necessarily right or wrong but they lead you down a path right so i do think theres some truth to that so this particular decision the blog had gotten fairly popular theres a lot of rss readers that i had discovered and this guy contacted me out of the blue from this like bug tracking company hes like oh i really wanna buy your blog for like i think it was around it was 100000 it might have been like 80000 but it was a lot right like and thats you know at the time like i would have a years worth of salary all at once so i didnt really think about like well you know and i remember talking to people at the time i was like wow thats a lot of money but then im like i really like my blog right like do i wanna sell my blog cause it wouldnt really belong to me anymore at that point and one of the guidelines that i like to i dont like to give advice to people a lot but one of the pieces of advice i do give cause i do think its really true and its generally helpful is whenever youre looking at a set of decisions like oh gosh should i do a b or c you gotta pick the thing thats a little scarier in that list because not you know not like jump off a cliff scary but the thing that makes you nervous cause if you pick the safe choice its usually youre not really pushing youre not pushing yourself youre not choosing the thing thats gonna help you grow so for me the scarier choice was to say no i was like well no lets just see where this is going right because then i own it i mean it belongs to me its my thing and i can just take it and tell some other logical conclusion right because imagine how different the world would have been had i said yes and sold the blog its like there probably wouldnt be stack overflow you know a lot of other stuff would have changed so for that particular decision i think it was that same rule like what scares me a little bit more do the thing that scares you yeah so speaking of which startups i think theres a specific some more general questions that a lot of people would be interested in youve started stack overflow you started this course so whats the it was one two three guys whatever it is in the beginning what was that process like do you start talking about it do you start programming do you start like wheres the birth and the catalyst that actually well i can talk about it in the context of both stack overflow and discourse so i think the key thing initially is there is a problem something theres some state of the world thats unsatisfactory to the point that like youre upset about it right like in that case it was experts exchange i mean joels original idea because i approached joel as like look joel i have all this energy behind my blog i want to do something i want to build something but i dont know what it is because im honestly not a good idea person im really not im like the execution guy im really good at execution but im not good at like blue skying ideas not my forte which is another reason why i like the community feedback because they blue sky all day long for you right so when i can just go in and cherry pick a blue sky idea from community even if i have to spend three hours reading to get one good idea its worth it man but anyway so the idea from joel was hey experts exchange its got great data but the experience is hideous right its trying to trick you it feels like used car salesman its just bad so i was like oh thats awesome it feeds into community it feeds into like you know we can make creative comments so i think the core is to have a really good idea that you feel very strongly about in the beginning that like theres a wrong in the world an injustice that we will write through the process of building this thing for discourse it was like look theres no good software for communities to just hang out and like do stuff right like whether its problem solving startup whatever forums are such a great building block of online community and theyre hideous they were so bad right it was embarrassing like i literally was embarrassed to be associated with this software right i was like we have to have software that you can be proud of its like this is competitive with reddit this is competitive with twitter this is competitive with facebook right i would be proud to have the software on my site so that was the genesis of discourse was feeling very strongly about there needs to be a good solution for communities so thats step one genesis of an idea you feel super strongly about right and then people galvanize around the idea like joel was already super excited about the idea i was excited about the idea so with the forum software i was posting on twitter i had researched as part of my research i start researching the problem right and i found a game called forum wars which was a parody of forum its still very very funny of forum behavior circa i would say 2003 its aged some right like the behaviors a little different in there of twitter but it was awesome it was very funny and it was like a game it was like an rpg and it had a forum attached to it so it was like a game about forums with a forum attached i was like this is awesome right this is so cool and the founder of that company or that project it wasnt really a company contacted me this guy robin ward from toronto he said hey i saw youve been talking about forums and i really love that problem space he was like id still love to build really good forum software because i dont think anything out theres any good and i was like awesome at that point i was like were starting a company because i couldnt have whooshed for a better person to walk through the door and say im excited about this too same thing with joel right i mean joel is a legend in the industry right so when he walked through and said im excited about this problem i was like me too man we can do this right so that to me is the most important step its like having an idea youre super excited about and another person a cofounder right because again you get that dual leadership right am i making a bad decision sometimes its nice to have checks of like is this a good idea i dont know right so those are the crucial seeds but then starting to build stuff whether its you programming or somebody elses there is prototyping so theres tons of research theres tons of research like whats out there that failed because a lot of people look at the successes oh look at how successful x is everybody looks at the successes those are boring show me the failures because that is whats interesting thats where people were experimenting thats where people were pushing and they failed but they probably failed for reasons that werent directly about the quality of their idea right so look at all the failures dont just look what everybody looks at which is like oh gosh look at all these successful people look at the failures look at the things that didnt work research the entire field and so thats the research that i was doing that led me to robin right was that and then when we for example when we did stack overflow were like okay well i really like elements of voting and dig and read it i like the wikipedia everythings up to date nothing is like an old tombstone that has horrible out of date information we know that works wikipedia is an amazing resource blogging the idea of ownership is so powerful right like oh i joe wrote this and look how good joes answer is right all these concepts were rolling together researching all the things that were out there that were working and why they were working and trying to fold them into again that frankensteins monster of what stack overflow is and by the way that wasnt a free decision because theres still a ton of tension in the stack overflow system theres reasons people complain about stack overflow because its so strict right why is it so strict why are you guys always closing my questions its because theres so much tension that we built into the system around trying to get good good results out of the system and its not a free that stuff doesnt come for free right its not like we we all have perfect answers and nobody will have to get their feelings heard or nobody will have to get downvoted it doesnt work that way right so this is an interesting point and a small tangent you write about anxiety so ive posted a lot of questions and written answers on stack overflow on the question side you usually go to something very specific to something im working on and this is something you talk about that really the goal of stack overflow isnt about is to write a question thats not about you its about the question that will help the community in the future right but thats a tough sell right because people are like well i dont really care about the community what i care about is my problem and thats fair right its sort of that again that tension that balancing act of we wanna help you but we also wanna help everybody that comes behind you the long line of people are gonna come up and say oh i kinda have that problem too right and if nobodys ever gonna come up and say i have this problem too then that question shouldnt exist on stack overflow because the question is too specific and even thats tension right how do you judge that how do you know that nobodys ever gonna have this particular question again so theres a lot of tension in the system do you think that anxiety of asking the question the anxiety of answering that tension is inherent to programmers is inherent to this kind of process or can it be improved can it be happy land where that tension is not quite so harsh i dont think stack overflow can totally change the way it works one thing they are working on finally is the ask page had not changed since 2011 im still kind of bitter about this because i feel like you have a qa system and what are the core pages in a qa system well first of all the question all the answers and also the ask page particularly when youre a new user or someone trying to ask a question thats the point at which you need the most help and we just didnt adapt with the times but the good news is theyre working on this from what i understand and its gonna be a more wizard based format and you could envision a world where as part of this wizard based program when youre asking questions okay come up with a good title what are good words to put in the title one word thats not good to put in the title is problem for example i have a problem oh you have a problem okay a problem thats great you need specifics so its trying to help you make a good question title for example that step will be broken out all that stuff but one of those steps in that wizard of asking could say hey im a little nervous ive never done this before can you put me in a queue for special mentoring you could opt in to a special mentor i think that would be fantastic i dont have any objection to that at all in terms of being an opt in system because there are people that are like i just wanna help them i wanna help a person no matter what i wanna go above and beyond i wanna spend hours with this person it depends what their goals are its a great idea who am i to judge so thats fine its not precluded from happening but theres a certain big city ethos that we started with like look were in new york city you dont come to new york city and expect them to be oh welcome to the city joe hows it going come on in let me show you around thats not how new york city works again new york city has a reputation for being rude which i actually dont think it is having been there fairly recently its not rude its just like going about their business like look i have things to do im busy im a busy professional as are you and since youre a busy professional certainly when you ask a question youre gonna ask the best possible question because youre a busy professional and you would not accept anything less than a very well written question with a lot of detail about why youre doing it what youre doing what you researched what you found because youre a professional like me and this rubs people sometimes the wrong way and i dont think its wrong to say look i dont want that experience i want just a more chill place for beginners and i still think stack overflow is not was never designed for beginners right theres this misconception that even joel says sometimes oh yeah stack overflow for beginners and i think if youre a prodigy it can be right but for the most part not but thats not really representative right like i think as a beginner you want a totally different set of tools you want like live screen sharing live chat you want access to resources you want a playground like a playground you can experiment in and like test and all this stuff that we just dont give people because that was never really the audience that we were designing stack overflow for that doesnt mean its wrong and i think it would be awesome if there was a site like that on the internet or if stack overflow said hey you know were gonna start doing this thats fine too you know im not there im not making those decisions but i do think the pressure the tension that you described is there for people to be look im a little nervous because i know i gotta do my best work right the other one is something you talk about which is also really interesting to me is duplicate questions or its a really difficult problem that you highlight its super hard like you could take one little topic and you could probably write 10 20 30 ways of asking about that topic and there will be all different i dont know if there should be one page that answers all of it is there a way that stack overflow can help disambiguate like separate these duplicate questions or connect them together or is it a totally hopeless difficult impossible task i think its a very very hard computer science problem and partly because people are very good at using completely different words it always amazed me on stack overflow youd have two questions that were functionally identical and one question had like zero words in common with the other question like oh my god from a computer science perspective how do you even begin to solve that and it happens all the time people are super good at this right accidentally at asking the same thing in like 10 20 different ways and the other complexity is we want some of those duplicates to exist because if theres five versions with different words have those five versions point to the one centralized answer right its like okay this is a duplicate no worries heres the answer that you wanted over here on the prime example that we want to have rather than having 10 copies of the question and the answer because if you have 10 copies of the question and answer this also devalues the reputation system which programmers hate as i previously mentioned youre getting reputation for an answer that somebody else already gave its like well its an answer but somebody else already gave that answer so why are you getting reputation for the same answer as the other guy who gave it four years ago people get offended by that right so the reputation system itself adds tension to the system in that the people who have a lot of reputation become very incentivized to enforce the reputation system and for the most part thats good i know it sounds weird but for most parts like look strict systems i think to use stack overflow you have to have the idea that ok strict systems ultimately work better and i do think in programming youre familiar with loose typing versus strict typing right the idea that you can declare a variable not declare a variable rather just start using a variable and ok i see its implicitly an integer bam awesome duck equals 5 well duck is now an integer of 5 right and youre like cool awesome simpler right why would i want to worry about typing and for a long time in the ruby community theyre like yeah this is awesome you just do a bunch of unit testing which is testing your programs validity after the fact to catch any bugs that strict typing of variables would have caught and now you have this thing called typescript for microsoft from the guy who built c sharp anders whos one of the greatest minds in software development right like in terms of language design and says no no no we want to bolt on a strict type system to javascript because it makes things better and now everybodys like oh my god we deployed typescript and found 50 latent bugs that we didnt know about right like this is super common so i think there is a truth in programming that strictness its not the goal were not saying be super strict because strictness is correct no its no no strictness produces better results thats what im saying right so strict typing of variables i would say you almost universally have consensus now is basically correct should be that way in every language right duck equals five should generate an error because no you didnt declare you didnt tell me that duck was an integer right thats a bug right or maybe you mistyped you typed deck instead of duck right you never know this happens all the time right so with that in mind i will say that the strictness of the system is correct now that doesnt mean cruel that doesnt mean mean that doesnt mean angry it just means strict ok so i think where theres misunderstanding is people get cranky right like another question you asked is like why are programmers kind of mean sometimes well who do programmers work with all day long so i have a theory that if youre at a job and you work with assholes all day long what do you eventually become an asshole an asshole and what is the computer except the worlds biggest asshole because the computer has no time for your bullshit the computer the minute you make a mistake everything is crashing down right one semicolon has crashed space missions right so thats normal so you begin to internalize that you begin to think oh my coworker the computer is super strict and kind of a jerk about everything so thats kind of how im going to be because i work with this computer and i have to exceed to its terms on everything so therefore you start to absorb that you start to think oh well being really strict arbitrarily is really good an error of error code 56249 is a completely good error message because thats what the computer gave me right so you kind of forget to be a person at some level and you know how they say great detectives internalize criminals and kind of are criminals themselves like this trope of the master detective is good because he can think like the criminal well i do think thats true of programmers really good programmers think like the computer because thats their job but if you internalize it too much you become the computer you kind of become a jerk to everybody because thats what youve internalized youre almost not a jerk but you have no patience for a lack of strictness as you said its not out of a sense of meanness its accidental but i do believe its an occupational hazard of being a programmer is you start to behave like the computer youre very unforgiving youre very terse youre very oh wrong incorrect move on its like well can you help me what could i do to fix no wrong next question like thats normal for the computer just fail next i dont know if you remember in saturday night live in the 90s they had this character who was an it guy the move guy move move was that jimmy fallon no no who played him ok yeah i remember move right he had no patience for it might have been mad tv actually wasnt it mad tv might have been but anyway thats always been the perception you start to behave like the computer its like oh youre wrong out of the way you know youve written so many blog posts about programming about programs programming programmers what do you think makes a good lets start with what makes a good solo programmer well i dont think you should be a solo programmer i think to be a good solo programmer its kind of like what i talked about well not on mike but one of the things john carmack one of the best points he makes in the book masters of doom which is a fantastic book and anybody listening to this who hasnt read it please read it its such a great book is that at the time they were working on stuff like wolfenstein and doom they didnt have the resources that we have today they didnt have stack overflow they didnt have wikipedia they didnt have discourse forums they didnt have places to go to get people to help them they had to work on their own and thats why it took a genius like carmack to do this stuff because you had to be a genius to invent from first principles a lot of the stuff he was like the hacks he was coming up with were genius genius level stuff but you dont need to be a genius anymore and that means not working by yourself you have to be good at researching stuff online you have to be good at asking questions really good questions that are really well researched which implies oh i went out and researched for three hours before i wrote these questions thats what you should be doing because thats whats going to make you good to me this is the big difference between programming in the 80s versus programming today is you kind of had to be by yourself back then where would you go for answers i remember in the early days when i was learning visual basic for windows i would call the microsoft helpline on the phone when i had programming because i was like i dont know what to do so i would go and call and they had these huge phone banks and im like can you imagine how alien that is now who would do that thats crazy so there was just nowhere else to go when you got stuck i had the books that came with it i read those studied those religiously i just saw a post from steve sanofsky that said the c version 7 came with 10000 pages of written material because where else were you going to figure that stuff out go to the library i mean you didnt have wikipedia you didnt have reddit you didnt have anywhere to go to answer these questions so youve talked about through the years basically not having an ego and not thinking that youre the best programmer in the world so always kind of just looking to improve to become a better programmer than you were yesterday so how have you changed as a programmer and as a thinker designer around programming over the past what is it 15 years really of being a public figure i would say the big insight that i had is eventually as a programmer you have to stop writing code to be effective which is kind of disturbing because you really love it but you realize being effective at programming at programming in the general sense doesnt mean writing code and a lot of times you can be much more successful by not writing code and writing code in terms of just solving the problems you have essentially hiring people that are really good and setting them free and giving them basic direction on strategy and stuff because a lot of the problems you encounter arent necessarily solved through really gnarly code theyre solved by conceptual solutions which can then be turned into code but are you even solving the right problem so i would say for me the main insight i have is to succeed as a programmer you eventually kind of stop writing code thats going to sound discouraging probably to people hearing but i dont mean it that way what i mean is that youre coding at a higher level language eventually like ok so were coding in assembly language thats the beginning right youre hardcoded to the architecture then you have stuff like c where its like wow we can abstract across the architecture we can write code i can then compile that code for arm or whatever x86 or whatever else is out there and then even higher level than that youre looking at python ruby interpreted languages and then to me as a programmer im like ok i want to go even higher i want to go higher than that how do i abstract higher than the language its like well you abstract in spoken language and written language right youre sort of inspiring people to get things done giving them guidance like what if we did this what if we did this youre writing in the highest level language that there is which is for me english whatever your spoken language is so its all about being effective right and i think patrick mckenzie patio11 on hacker news and works at stripe has a great post about this of how calling yourself a programmer is a career limiting move at some level once you get far enough from your career and i really believe that and again i apologize this is sound discouraging i dont mean it to be but hes so right because all the stuff that goes on around the code like the people thats another thing if you look at my early blog entries is about wow programming is about people more than its about code which doesnt really make sense but its about can these people even get along together can they understand each other can you even explain to me what it is youre working on are you solving the right problem peopleware another classic programming book which again up there with code complete please read peopleware its that software is people people are the software first and foremost so a lot of the skills that i was working on early in the blog were about figuring out the people parts of programming which were the harder parts the hard part of programming once you get a certain skill level in programming you can pretty much solve any reasonable problem thats put in front of you youre not writing algorithms from scratch that just doesnt happen so any sort of reasonable problem put in front of you youre going to be able to solve but what you cant solve is our manager is a total jerk you cannot solve that with code that is not a code solvable problem and yet that will cripple you way more than oh we had to use this stupid framework i dont like or sam keeps writing bad code that i hate or dave is off there in the wilderness writing god knows what these are not your problems your problem is your manager or a co worker is so toxic to everybody else in your team that nobody can get anything done because everybodys so stressed out and freaked out these are the problems that you have to attack absolutely and so as you go to these higher level abstractions as youve developed as a programmer to higher and higher level abstractions and go into natural language youre also the guy who preached building it diving in and doing it and learn by doing yes do you worry that as you get to higher and higher level abstractions you lose track of the lower level of just building do you worry about that even not maybe now but 10 years from now 20 years from now well no i mean there is always that paranoia around oh gosh i dont feel its valuable since im not writing code but for me when we started the discourse project it was ruby which i didnt really know ruby i mean as you pointed out and this is another valuable observation in stack overflow you can be super proficient in for example c sharp which i was working in thats what we built stack overflow in and still is written in and then switch to ruby and youre a newbie again but you have the framework i know what a for loop is i know what recursion is i know what a stack trace is i have all the fundamental concepts to be a programmer i just dont know ruby so im still on a higher level im not like a beginner beginner like youre saying im just like i need to apply my programming concepts i already know to ruby well so theres a question thats really interesting so looking at ruby how do you go about learning enough that your intuition can be applied carried over thats what i was trying to get to its like what i realized particularly when i started with just me and robin i realized if i bother robin i am now costing us productivity every time i go to robin rather than building our first alpha version of discourse hes now answering my stupid questions about ruby is that a good use of his time is that a good use of my time and the answer to both of those was resoundingly no we were getting to an alpha and it was pretty much just ok well hire more programmers we eventually hired neil and then eventually sam who came in as a cofounder actually it was sam first then neil later but the answer to the problem is just hire other competent programmers now i shall pull myself up by my bootstraps and learn ruby but at some point writing code becomes a liability to you in terms of getting things done theres so many other things that go on in the project like building the prototype you mentioned well how do you if youre not writing code how does everybody keep focus on what are we building well first basic mockups and research what do we even want to build theres a little bit of that that goes on but then very quickly you get to the prototype stage like build a prototype lets iterate on the prototype really really rapidly and thats what we do with discourse and thats what we demoed to get our seed funding for discourse was the alpha version of discourse that we had running and ready to go and it was very it was bad i mean it was ill just tell you it was bad we have screenshots of it im just embarrassed to look at it now but it was the prototype we were figuring out whats working whats not working because theres such a broad gap between the way you think things will work in your mind or even on paper and the way they work once you sit and live in the software like actually spend time living and breathing in software so different so my philosophy is get to a prototype and then what youre really optimizing for is speed of iteration like how you can turn the crank how quickly can we iterate thats the absolutely critical metric of any software project and i had a tweet recently that people liked and i totally this is so fundamental to what i do is like if you want to measure the core competency of any software tech company its the speed at which somebody can say hey we really need this word in the product change this word right because it will be more clear to the user like instead of respond its reply or something but theres some from the conception of that idea to how quickly that single word can be changed in your software and rolled out to users that is your life cycle thats your health your heartbeat if your heartbeat is like super slow youre basically dead no seriously like if it takes two weeks or even a month to get that single word changed everybodys like oh my god this is a great idea that word is so much clearer im talking about like a super like everybodys on board for this change its not like lets just change a word because were bored its like this is an awesome change and then it takes months to roll out its like well youre dead you cant iterate you cant how are you going to do anything right so anyway about the heartbeat its like get the prototype and then iterate on it thats what i view as the central tenet of modern software development thats fascinating that you put it that way so i work and i build autonomous vehicles and when you look at what maybe compare tesla to most other automakers the heart beat for tesla is literally days now in terms of they can over the air deploy software updates to all their vehicles which is markedly different than every other automaker which takes years to update a piece of software and thats reflected in everything thats the final product thats reflected in really how slowly they adapt to the times and to be clear im not saying being a hummingbird is the goal either',\n",
       " 'the following is a conversation with eric schmidt he was the ceo of google for 10 years and a chairman for six more guiding the company through an incredible period of growth and a series of world changing innovations he is one of the most impactful leaders in the era of the internet and the powerful voice for the promise of technology in our society it was truly an honor to speak with him as part of the mit course on artificial general intelligence and the artificial intelligence podcast and now heres my conversation with eric schmidt what was the first moment when you fell in love with technology i grew up in the 1960s as a boy where every boy wanted to be an astronaut and part of the space program so like everyone else of my age we would go out to the cow pasture behind my house which was literally a cow pasture and we would shoot model rockets off and that i think is the beginning and of course generationally today it would be video games and all the amazing things that you can do online with computers theres a transformative inspiring aspect of science and math that maybe rockets would bring would instill in individuals youve mentioned yesterday that eighth grade math is where the journey through mathematical universe diverges from many people its this fork in the roadway theres a professor of math at berkeley edward frankel he im not sure if youre familiar with him i am he has written this amazing book i recommend to everybody called love and math two of my favorite words he says that if painting was taught like math then the students would be asked to paint a fence which is his analogy of essentially how math is taught and so you never get a chance to discover the beauty of the art of painting or the beauty of the art of math so how when and where did you discover that beauty i think what happens with people like myself is that your math enabled pretty early and all of a sudden you discover that you can use that to discover new insights the great scientists will all tell a story the men and women who are fantastic today that somewhere when they were in high school or in college they discovered that they could discover something themselves and that sense of building something of having an impact that you own drives knowledge acquisition and learning in my case it was programming and the notion that i could build things that had not existed that i had built that it had my name on it and this was before open source but you could think of it as open source contributions so today if i were a 16 or 17 year old boy im sure that i would aspire as a computer scientist to make a contribution like the open source heroes of the world today that would be what would be driving me and id be trying and learning and making mistakes and so forth in the ways that it works the repository that github represents and that open source libraries represent is an enormous bank of knowledge of all of the people who are doing that and one of the lessons that i learned at google was that the world is a very big place and theres an awful lot of smart people and an awful lot of them are underutilized so heres an opportunity for example building parts of programs building new ideas to contribute to the greater of society so in that moment in the 70s the inspiring moment where there was nothing and then you created something through programming that magical moment so in 1975 i think youve created a program called lex which i especially like because my name is lex so thank you thank you for creating a brand that established a reputation thats long lasting reliable and has a big impact on the world and still used today so thank you for that but more seriously in that time in the 70s as an engineer personal computers were being born do you think youd be able to predict the 80s 90s and the aughts of where computers would go im sure i could not and would not have gotten it right i was the beneficiary of the great work of many many people who saw it clearer than i did with lex i worked with a fellow named michael lesk who was my supervisor and he essentially helped me architect and deliver a system thats still in use today after that i worked at xerox palo alto research center where the alto was invented and the alto is the predecessor of the modern personal computer or macintosh and so forth and the altos were very rare and i had to drive an hour from berkeley to go use them but i made a point of skipping classes and doing whatever it took to have access to this extraordinary achievement i knew that they were consequential what i did not understand was scaling i did not understand what would happen when you had 100 million as opposed to 100 and so the since then and i have learned the benefit of scale i always look for things which are going to scale to platforms right so mobile phones android all those things there are the world is in numerous there are many many people in the world people really have needs they really will use these platforms and you can build big businesses on top of them so its interesting so when you see a piece of technology now you think what will this technology look like when its in the hands of a billion people thats right so an example would be that the market is so competitive now that if you cant figure out a way for something to have a million users or a billion users it probably is not going to be successful because something else will become the general platform and your idea will become a lost idea or a specialized service with relatively few users so its a path to generality its a path to general platform use its a path to broad applicability now there are plenty of good businesses that are tiny so luxury goods for example but if you want to have an impact at scale you have to look for things which are of common value common pricing common distribution and solve common problems theyre problems that everyone has and by the way people have lots of problems information medicine health education and so forth work on those problems like you said youre a big fan of the middle class because theres so many of them theres so many of them by definition so any product any thing that has a huge impact and improves their lives is a great business decision and its just good for society and theres nothing wrong with starting off in the high end as long as you have a plan to get to the middle class theres nothing wrong with starting with a specialized market in order to learn and to build and to fund things so you start with a luxury market to build a general purpose market but if you define yourself as only a narrow market someone else can come along with a general purpose market that can push you to the corner can restrict the scale of operation can force you to be a lesser impact than you might be so its very important to think in terms of broad businesses and broad impact even if you start in a little corner somewhere so as you look to the 70s but also in the decades to come and you saw computers did you see them as tools or was there a little element of another entity i remember a quote saying ai began with our dream to create the gods is there a feeling when you wrote that program that you were creating another entity giving life to something i wish i could say otherwise but i simply found the technology platforms so exciting thats what i was focused on i think the majority of the people that ive worked with and there are a few exceptions steve jobs being an example really saw this as a great technological play i think relatively few of the technical people understood the scale of its impact so i used ncp which is a predecessor to tcpip it just made sense to connect things we didnt think of it in terms of the internet and then companies and then facebook and then twitter and then politics and so forth we never did that build we didnt have that vision and i think most people its a rare person who can see compounding at scale most people can see if you ask people to predict the future theyll give you an answer of six to nine months or 12 months because thats about as far as people can imagine but theres an old saying which actually was attributed to a professor at mit a long time ago that we overestimate what can be done in one year and we underestimate what can be done in a decade and theres a great deal of evidence that these core platforms at hardware and software take a decade right so think about self driving cars self driving cars were thought about in the 90s there were projects around them the first darpa grand challenge was roughly 2004 so thats roughly 15 years ago and today we have self driving cars operating in a city in arizona right its 15 years and we still have a ways to go before theyre more generally available so youve spoken about the importance you just talked about predicting into the future youve spoken about the importance of thinking five years ahead and having a plan for those five years the way to say it is that almost everybody has a one year plan almost no one has a proper five year plan and the key thing to having a five year plan is to having a model for whats going to happen under the underlying platforms so heres an example moores law as we know it the thing that powered improvements in cpus has largely halted in its traditional shrinking mechanism because the costs have just gotten so high its getting harder and harder but theres plenty of algorithmic improvements and specialized hardware improvements so you need to understand the nature of those improvements and where theyll go in order to understand how it will change the platform in the area of network connectivity what are the gains that are gonna be possible in wireless it looks like theres an enormous expansion of wireless connectivity at many different bands and that we will primarily historically ive always thought that we were primarily gonna be using fiber but now it looks like were gonna be using fiber plus very powerful high bandwidth sort of short distance connectivity to bridge the last mile thats an amazing achievement if you know that then youre gonna build your systems differently by the way those networks have different latency properties right because theyre more symmetric the algorithms feel faster for that reason and so when you think about whether its a fiber or just technologies in general so theres this barber wooden poem or quote that i really like its from the champions of the impossible rather than the slaves of the possible that evolution draws its creative force so in predicting the next five years id like to talk about the impossible and the possible well and again one of the great things about humanity is that we produce dreamers right we literally have people who have a vision and a dream they are if you will disagreeable in the sense that they disagree with the they disagree with what the sort of zeitgeist is they say there is another way they have a belief they have a vision if you look at science science is always marked by such people who went against some conventional wisdom collected the knowledge at the time and assembled it in a way that produced a powerful platform and youve been amazingly honest about in an inspiring way about things youve been wrong about predicting and youve obviously been right about a lot of things but in this kind of tension how do you balance as a company in predicting the next five years the impossible planning for the impossible so listening to those crazy dreamers letting them do letting them run away and make the impossible real make it happen and slow you know thats how programmers often think and slowing things down and saying well this is the rational this is the possible the pragmatic the dreamer versus the pragmatist so its helpful to have a model which encourages a predictable revenue stream as well as the ability to do new things so in googles case were big enough and well enough managed and so forth that we have a pretty good sense of what our revenue will be for the next year or two at least for a while and so we have enough cash generation that we can make bets and indeed google has become alphabet so the corporation is organized around these bets and these bets are in areas of fundamental importance to the world whether its artificial intelligence medical technology self driving cars connectivity through balloons on and on and on and theres more coming and more coming so one way you could express this is that the current business is successful enough that we have the luxury of making bets and another one that you could say is that we have the wisdom of being able to see that a corporate structure needs to be created to enhance the likelihood of the success of those bets so we essentially turned ourselves into a conglomerate of bets and then this underlying corporation google which is itself innovative so in order to pull this off you have to have a bunch of belief systems and one of them is that you have to have bottoms up and tops down the bottoms up we call 20 time and the idea is that people can spend 20 of the time whatever they want and the top down is that our founders in particular have a keen eye on technology and theyre reviewing things constantly so an example would be theyll hear about an idea or ill hear about something and it sounds interesting lets go visit them and then lets begin to assemble the pieces to see if thats possible and if you do this long enough you get pretty good at predicting whats likely to work so thats a beautiful balance that struck is this something that applies at all scale it seems to be that sergey again 15 years ago came up with a concept called 10 of the budget should be on things that are unrelated it was called 70 20 10 70 of our time on core business 20 on adjacent business and 10 on other and he proved mathematically of course hes a brilliant mathematician that you needed that 10 to make the sum of the growth work and it turns out he was right so getting into the world of artificial intelligence youve talked quite extensively and effectively to the impact in the near term the positive impact of artificial intelligence whether its especially machine learning in medical applications and education and just making information more accessible right in the ai community there is a kind of debate theres this shroud of uncertainty as we face this new world with artificial intelligence in it and theres some people like elon musk youve disagreed at least on the degree of emphasis he places on the existential threat of ai so ive spoken with stuart russell max tegmark who share elon musks view and yoshua bengio steven pinker who do not and so theres a lot of very smart people who are thinking about this stuff disagreeing which is really healthy of course so what do you think is the healthiest way for the ai community to and really for the general public to think about ai and the concern of the technology being mismanaged in some kind of way so the source of education for the general public has been robot killer movies right and terminator et cetera and the one thing i can assure you were not building are those kinds of solutions furthermore if they were to show up someone would notice and unplug them right so as exciting as those movies are and theyre great movies were the killer robots to start we would find a way to stop them right so im not concerned about that and much of this has to do with the timeframe of conversation so you can imagine a situation 100 years from now when the human brain is fully understood and the next generation and next generation of brilliant mit scientists have figured all this out were gonna have a large number of ethics questions right around science and thinking and robots and computers and so forth and so on so it depends on the question of the timeframe in the next five to 10 years were not facing those questions what were facing in the next five to 10 years is how do we spread this disruptive technology as broadly as possible to gain the maximum benefit of it the primary benefits should be in healthcare and in education healthcare because its obvious were all the same even though we somehow believe were not as a medical matter the fact that we have big data about our health will save lives allow us to deal with skin cancer and other cancers ophthalmological problems theres people working on psychological diseases and so forth using these techniques i can go on and on the promise of ai in medicine is extraordinary there are many many companies and startups and funds and solutions and we will all live much better for that the same argument in education can you imagine that for each generation of child and even adult you have a tutor educator thats ai based thats not a human but is properly trained that helps you get smarter helps you address your language difficulties or your math difficulties or what have you why dont we focus on those two the gains societally of making humans smarter and healthier are enormous and those translate for decades and decades and well all benefit from them there are people who are working on ai safety which is the issue that youre describing and there are conversations in the community that should there be such problems what should the rules be like google for example has announced its policies with respect to ai safety which i certainly support and i think most everybody would support and they make sense right so it helps guide the research but the killer robots are not arriving this year and theyre not even being built and on that line of thinking you said the time scale in this topic or other topics have you found it useful on the business side or the intellectual side to think beyond five 10 years to think 50 years out has it ever been useful or productive in our industry there are essentially no examples of 50 year predictions that have been correct lets review ai right ai which was largely invented here at mit and a couple of other universities in the 1956 1957 1958 the original claims were a decade or two and when i was a phd student i studied ai a bit and it entered during my looking at it a period which is known as ai winter which went on for about 30 years which is a whole generation of science scientists and a whole group of people who didnt make a lot of progress because the algorithms had not improved and the computers had not approved it took some brilliant mathematicians starting with a fellow named jeff hinton at toronto and montreal who basically invented this deep learning model which empowers us today the seminal work there was 20 years ago and in the last 10 years its become popularized so think about the timeframes for that level of discovery its very hard to predict many people think that well be flying around in the equivalent of flying cars who knows my own view if i wanna go out on a limb is to say that we know a couple of things about 50 years from now we know that therell be more people alive we know that well have to have platforms that are more sustainable because the earth is limited in the ways we all know and that the kind of platforms that are gonna get built will be consistent with the principles that ive described they will be much more empowering of individuals theyll be much more sensitive to the ecology because they have to be they just have to be i also think that humans are gonna be a great deal smarter and i think theyre gonna be a lot smarter because of the tools that ive discussed with you and of course people will live longer life extension is continuing apace a baby born today has a reasonable chance of living to 100 which is pretty exciting its well past the 21st century so we better take care of them and you mentioned an interesting statistic on some very large percentage 60 70 of people may live in cities today more than half the world lives in cities and one of the great stories of humanity in the last 20 years has been the rural to urban migration this has occurred in the united states its occurred in europe its occurring in asia and its occurring in africa when people move to cities the cities get more crowded but believe it or not their health gets better their productivity gets better their iq and educational capabilities improve so its good news that people are moving to cities but we have to make them livable and safe so you first of all you are but youve also worked with some of the greatest leaders in the history of tech what insights do you draw from the difference in leadership styles of yourself steve jobs elon musk larry page now the new ceo sandra pichai and others from the i would say calm sages to the mad geniuses one of the things that i learned as a young executive is that theres no single formula for leadership they try to teach one but thats not how it really works there are people who just understand what they need to do and they need to do it quickly those people are often entrepreneurs they just know and they move fast there are other people who are systems thinkers and planners thats more who i am somewhat more conservative more thorough in execution a little bit more risk of risk a little bit more risk averse theres also people who are sort of slightly insane in the sense that they are emphatic and charismatic and they feel it and they drive it and so forth theres no single formula to success there is one thing that unifies all of the people that you named which is very high intelligence at the end of the day the thing that characterizes all of them is that they saw the world quicker faster they processed information faster they didnt necessarily make the right decisions all the time but they were on top of it and the other thing thats interesting about all those people is they all started young so think about steve jobs starting apple roughly at 18 or 19 think about bill gates starting at roughly 20 21 think about by the time they were 30 mark zuckerberg a good example at 19 20 by the time they were 30 they had 10 years at 30 years old they had 10 years of experience of dealing with people and products and shipments and the press and business and so forth its incredible how much experience they had compared to the rest of us who were busy getting our phds yes exactly so we should celebrate these people because theyve just had more life experience right and that helps inform the judgment at the end of the day when youre at the top of these organizations all the easy questions have been dealt with right how should we design the buildings where should we put the colors on our product what should the box look like right the problems thats why its so interesting to be in these rooms the problems that they face right in terms of the way they operate the way they deal with their employees their customers their innovation are profoundly challenging each of the companies is demonstrably different culturally they are not in fact cut of the same they behave differently based on input their internal cultures are different their compensation schemes are different their values are different so theres proof that diversity works so so when faced with a tough decision in need of advice its been said that the best thing one can do is to find the best person in the world who can give that advice and find a way to be in a room with them one on one and ask so here we are and let me ask in a long winded way i wrote this down in 1998 there were many good search engines lycos excite altavista infoseek ask jeeves maybe yahoo even so google stepped in and disrupted everything they disrupted the nature of search the nature of our access to information the way we discover new knowledge so now its 2018 actually 20 years later there are many good personal ai assistants including of course the best from google so youve spoken in medical and education the impact of such an ai assistant could bring so we arrive at this question so its a personal one for me but i hope my situation represents that of many other as we said dreamers and the crazy engineers so my whole life ive dreamed of creating such an ai assistant every step ive taken has been towards that goal now im a research scientist in human centered ai here at mit so the next step for me as i sit here so facing my passion is to do what larry and sergey did in 98 this simple startup and so heres my simple question given the low odds of success the timing and luck required the countless other factors that cant be controlled or predicted which is all the things that larry and sergey faced is there some calculation some strategy to follow in this step or do you simply follow the passion just because theres no other choice i think the people who are in universities are always trying to study the extraordinarily chaotic nature of innovation and entrepreneurship my answer is that they didnt have that conversation they just did it they sensed a moment when in the case of google there was all of this data that needed to be organized and they had a better algorithm they had invented a better way so today with human centered ai which is your area of research there must be new approaches its such a big field there must be new approaches different from what we and others are doing there must be startups to fund there must be research projects to try there must be graduate students to work on new approaches here at mit there are people who are looking at learning from the standpoint of looking at child learning how do children learn starting at age one and two and the work is fantastic those approaches are different from the approach that most people are taking perhaps thats a bet that you should make or perhaps theres another one but at the end of the day the successful entrepreneurs are not as crazy as they sound they see an opportunity based on whats happened lets use uber as an example as travis sells the story he and his co founder were sitting in paris and they had this idea because they couldnt get a cab and they said we have smartphones and the rest is history so whats the equivalent of that travis eiffel tower where is a cab moment that you could as an entrepreneur take advantage of whether its in human centered ai or something else thats the next great startup and the psychology of that moment so when sergey and larry talk about and listen to a few interviews its very nonchalant well heres the very fascinating web data and heres an algorithm we have for we just kind of want to play around with that data and it seems like thats a really nice way to organize this data i should say what happened to remember is that they were graduate students at stanford and they thought this was interesting so they built a search engine and they kept it in their room and they had to get power from the room next door because they were using too much power in the room so they ran an extension cord over right and then they went and they found a house and they had google world headquarters of five people right to start the company and they raised 100000 from andy bechtolsheim who was the sun founder to do this and dave cheriton and a few others the point is their beginnings were very simple but they were based on a powerful insight that is a replicable model for any startup it has to be a powerful insight the beginnings are simple and there has to be an innovation in larry and sergeys case it was pagerank which was a brilliant idea one of the most cited papers in the world today whats the next one so youre one of if i may say richest people in the world and yet it seems that money is simply a side effect of your passions and not an inherent goal but youre a fascinating person to ask so much of our society at the individual level and at the company level and as nations is driven by the desire for wealth what do you think about this drive and what have you learned about if i may romanticize the notion the meaning of life having achieved success on so many dimensions there have been many studies of human happiness and above some threshold which is typically relatively low for this conversation theres no difference in happiness about money the happiness is correlated with meaning and purpose a sense of family a sense of impact so if you organize your life assuming you have enough to get around and have a nice home and so forth youll be far happier if you figure out what you care about and work on that its often being in service to others theres a great deal of evidence that people are happiest when theyre serving others and not themselves this goes directly against the sort of press induced excitement about powerful and wealthy leaders of one kind and indeed these are consequential people but if you are in a situation where youve been very fortunate as i have you also have to take that as a responsibility and you have to basically work both to educate others and give them that opportunity but also use that wealth to advance human society in my case im particularly interested in using the tools of artificial intelligence and machine learning to make society better ive mentioned education ive mentioned inequality and middle class and things like this all of which are a passion of mine it doesnt matter what you do it matters that you believe in it that its important to you and that your life will be far more satisfying if you spend your life doing that i think theres no better place to end than a discussion of the meaning of life eric thank you so much',\n",
       " 'the following is a conversation with stuart russell hes a professor of computer science at uc berkeley and a coauthor of a book that introduced me and millions of other people to the amazing world of ai called artificial intelligence a modern approach so it was an honor for me to have this conversation as part of mit course in artificial general intelligence and the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it please subscribe on youtube itunes or your podcast provider of choice or simply connect with me on twitter at lex friedman spelled f r i d and now heres my conversation with stuart russell so youve mentioned in 1975 in high school youve created one of your first ai programs that play chess were you ever able to build a program that beat you at chess or another board game so my program never beat me at chess i actually wrote the program at imperial college so i used to take the bus every wednesday with a box of cards this big and shove them into the card reader and they gave us eight seconds of cpu time it took about five seconds to read the cards in and compile the code so we had three seconds of cpu time which was enough to make one move you know with a not very deep search and then we would print that move out and then wed have to go to the back of the queue and wait to feed the cards in again how deep was the search are we talking about one move two moves three moves no i think we got an eight move a depth eight with alpha beta and we had some tricks of our own about move ordering and some pruning of the tree but you were still able to beat that program yeah yeah i was a reasonable chess player in my youth i did an othello program and a backgammon program so when i got to berkeley i worked a lot on what we call meta reasoning which really means reasoning about reasoning and in the case of a game playing program you need to reason about what parts of the search tree youre actually going to explore because the search tree is enormous bigger than the number of atoms in the universe and the way programs succeed and the way humans succeed is by only looking at a small fraction of the search tree and if you look at the right fraction you play really well if you look at the wrong fraction if you waste your time thinking about things that are never going to happen moves that no ones ever going to make then youre going to lose because you wont be able to figure out the right decision so that question of how machines can manage their own computation how they decide what to think about is the meta reasoning question and we developed some methods for doing that and very simply the machine should think about whatever thoughts are going to improve its decision quality we were able to show that both for othello which is a standard two player game and for backgammon which includes dice rolls so its a two player game with uncertainty for both of those cases we could come up with algorithms that were actually much more efficient than the standard alpha beta search which chess programs at the time were using and that those programs could beat me and i think you can see the same basic ideas in alpha go and alpha zero today the way they explore the tree is using a form of meta reasoning to select what to think about based on how useful it is to think about it is there any insights you can describe with our greek symbols of how do we select which paths to go down theres really two kinds of learning going on so as you say alpha go learns to evaluate board positions so it can look at a go board and it actually has probably a superhuman ability to instantly tell how promising that situation is to me the amazing thing about alpha go is not that it can be the world champion with its hands tied behind his back but the fact that if you stop it from searching altogether so you say okay youre not allowed to do any thinking ahead you can just consider each of your legal moves and then look at the resulting situation and evaluate it so what we call a depth one search so just the immediate outcome of your moves and decide if thats good or bad that version of alpha go can still play at a professional level and human professionals are sitting there for five 10 minutes deciding what to do and alpha go in less than a second can instantly intuit what is the right move to make based on its ability to evaluate positions and that is remarkable because we dont have that level of intuition about go we actually have to think about the situation so anyway that capability that alpha go has is one big part of why it beats humans the other big part is that its able to look ahead 40 50 60 moves into the future and if it was considering all possibilities 40 or 50 or 60 moves into the future that would be 10 to the 200 possibilities so way more than atoms in the universe and so on so its very very selective about what it looks at so let me try to give you an intuition about how you decide what to think about its a combination of two things one is how promising it is so if youre already convinced that a move is terrible theres no point spending a lot more time convincing yourself that its terrible because its probably not going to change your mind so the real reason you think is because theres some possibility of changing your mind about what to do and its that changing your mind that would result then in a better final action in the real world so thats the purpose of thinking is to improve the final action in the real world so if you think about a move that is guaranteed to be terrible you can convince yourself its terrible youre still not going to change your mind but on the other hand suppose you had a choice between two moves one of them youve already figured out is guaranteed to be a draw lets say and then the other one looks a little bit worse it looks fairly likely that if you make that move youre going to lose but theres still some uncertainty about the value of that move theres still some possibility that it will turn out to be a win then its worth thinking about that so even though its less promising on average than the other move which is a good move its worth thinking about on average than the other move which is guaranteed to be a draw theres still some purpose in thinking about it because theres a chance that you will change your mind and discover that in fact its a better move so its a combination of how good the move appears to be and how much uncertainty there is about its value the more uncertainty the more its worth thinking about because theres a higher upside if you want to think of it that way and of course in the beginning especially in the alphago zero formulation everything is shrouded in uncertainty so youre really swimming in a sea of uncertainty so it benefits you to i mean actually following the same process as you described but because youre so uncertain about everything you basically have to try a lot of different directions yeah so the early parts of the search tree are fairly bushy that it will look at a lot of different possibilities but fairly quickly the degree of certainty about some of the moves i mean if a move is really terrible youll pretty quickly find out right you lose half your pieces or half your territory and then youll say okay this is not worth thinking about anymore and then so further down the tree becomes very long and narrow and youre following various lines of play 10 20 30 40 50 moves into the future and that again is something that human beings have a very hard time doing mainly because they just lack the short term memory you just cant remember a sequence of moves thats 50 moves long and you cant imagine the board correctly for that many moves into the future of course the top players im much more familiar with chess but the top players probably have they have echoes of the same kind of intuition instinct that in a moments time alphago applies when they see a board i mean theyve seen those patterns human beings have seen those patterns before at the top at the grandmaster level it seems that there is some similarities or maybe its our imagination creates a vision of those similarities but it feels like this kind of pattern recognition that the alphago approaches are using is similar to what human beings at the top level are using i think theres theres some truth to that but not entirely yeah i mean i think the the extent to which a human grandmaster can reliably instantly recognize the right move and instantly recognize the value of the position i think thats a little bit overrated but if you sacrifice a queen for example i mean theres these theres these beautiful games of chess with bobby fischer somebody where its seeming to make a bad move and im not sure theres a perfect degree of calculation involved where theyve calculated all the possible things that happen but theres an instinct there right that somehow adds up to yeah so i think what happens is you you you get a sense that theres some possibility in the position even if you make a weird looking move that it opens up some some lines of of calculation that otherwise would be definitely bad and and its that intuition that theres something here in this position that might might yield a win and then you follow that right and and in some sense when a when a chess player is following a line and in his or her mind theyre theyre mentally simulating what the other person is going to do what the opponent is going to do and they can do that as long as the moves are kind of forced right as long as theres you know theres a a fort we call a forcing variation where the opponent doesnt really have much choice how to respond and then you follow that how to respond and then you see if you can force them into a situation where you win you know we see plenty of mistakes even even in grandmaster games where they just miss some simple three four five move combination that you know wasnt particularly apparent in in the position but was still there thats the thing that makes us human yeah so when you mentioned that in othello those games were after some matter reasoning improvements and research was able to beat you how did that make you feel part of the meta reasoning capability that it had was based on learning and and you could sit down the next day and you could just feel that it had got a lot smarter you know and all of a sudden you really felt like youre sort of pressed against the wall because it was it was much more aggressive and and was totally unforgiving of any minor mistake that you might make and and actually it seemed understood the game better than i did and gary kasparov has this quote where during his match against deep blue he said he suddenly felt that there was a new kind of intelligence across the board do you think thats a scary or an exciting possibility for for kasparov and for yourself in in the context of chess purely sort of in this like that feeling whatever that is i think its definitely an exciting feeling you know this is what made me work on ai in the first place was as soon as i really understood what a computer was i wanted to make it smart you know i started out with the first program i wrote was for the sinclair programmable calculator and i think you could write a 21 step algorithm that was the biggest program you could write something like that and do little arithmetic calculations so i think i implemented newtons method for a square roots and a few other things like that but then you know i thought okay if i just had more space i could make this thing intelligent and so i started thinking about ai and and i think the the the thing thats scary is not is not the chess program because you know chess programs theyre not in the taking over the world business but if you extrapolate you know there are things about chess that dont resemble the real world right we know we know the rules of chess the chess board is completely visible to the program where of course the real world is not most most of the real world is is not visible from wherever youre sitting so to speak and to overcome those kinds of problems you need qualitatively different algorithms another thing about the real world is that you know we we regularly plan ahead on the timescales involving billions or trillions of steps now we dont plan those in detail but you know when you choose to do a phd at berkeley thats a five year commitment and that amounts to about a trillion motor control steps that you will eventually be committed to including going up the stairs opening doors drinking water yeah i mean every every finger movement while youre typing every character of every paper and the thesis and everything so youre not committing in advance to the specific motor control steps but youre still reasoning on a timescale that will eventually reduce to trillions of motor control actions and so for all of these reasons you know alphago and deep blue and so on dont represent any kind of threat to humanity but they are a step towards it right and progress in ai occurs by essentially removing one by one these assumptions that make problems easy like the assumption of complete observability of the situation right we remove that assumption you need a much more complicated kind of computing design it needs it needs something that actually keeps track of all the things you cant see and tries to estimate whats going on and theres inevitable uncertainty in that so it becomes a much more complicated problem but you know we are removing those assumptions we are starting to have algorithms that can cope with much longer timescales that can cope with uncertainty that can cope with partial observability and so each of those steps sort of magnifies by a thousand the range of things that we can do with ai systems so the way i started in ai i wanted to be a psychiatrist for a long time i wanted to understand the mind in high school and of course program and so on and i showed up university of illinois to an ai lab and they said okay i dont have time for you but heres a book ai and modern approach i think it was the first edition at the time here go go go learn this and i remember the lay of the land was well its incredible that we solved chess but well never solve go i mean it was pretty certain that go in the way we thought about systems that reason wasnt possible to solve and now weve solved this so its a very well i think i would have said that its unlikely we could take the kind of algorithm that was used for chess and just get it to scale up and work well for go and at the time what we thought was that in order to solve go we would have to do something similar to the way humans manage the complexity of go which is to break it down into kind of sub games so when a human thinks about a go board they think about different parts of the board as sort of weakly connected to each other and they think about okay within this part of the board heres how things could go in that part of board heres how things could go and then you try to sort of couple those two analyses together and deal with the interactions and maybe revise your views of how things are going to go in each part and then youve got maybe five six seven ten parts of the board and that actually resembles the real world much more than chess does because in the real world we have work we have home life we have sport different kinds of activities shopping these all are connected to each other but theyre weakly connected so when im typing a paper i dont simultaneously have to decide which order im going to get the milk and the butter that doesnt affect the typing but i do need to realize okay i better finish this before the shops close because i dont have anything i dont have any food at home so theres some weak connection but not in the way that chess works where everything is tied into a single stream of thought so the thought was that to solve go wed have to make progress on stuff that would be useful for the real world and in a way alphago is a little bit disappointing right because the program designed for alphago is actually not that different from deep blue or even from arthur samuels checker playing program from the 1950s and in fact the two things that make alphago work is one is this amazing ability to evaluate the positions and the other is the meta reasoning capability which allows it to explore some paths in the tree very deeply and to abandon other paths very quickly including yourself because youre on camera now and your voice is coming through with high resolution yeah so you could take what im saying and replace it with pretty much anything else you wanted me to be saying and its a very simple thing take what im saying and replace it with pretty much anything else you wanted me to be saying and even it would change my lips and facial expressions to fit and theres actually not much in the way of real legal protection against that i think in the commercial area you could say yeah youre using my brand and so on there are rules about that but in the political sphere i think at the moment anything goes that could be really really damaging and let me just try to make not an argument but try to look back at history and say something dark in essence is while regulation seems to be oversight seems to be exactly the right thing to do here it seems that human beings what they naturally do is they wait for something to go wrong if youre talking about nuclear weapons you cant talk about nuclear weapons being dangerous until somebody actually like the united states drops the bomb or chernobyl melting do you think we will have to wait for things going wrong in a way thats obviously damaging to society not an existential risk but obviously damaging or do you have faith that i hope not but i think we do have to look at history and so the two examples you gave nuclear weapons and nuclear power are very very interesting because nuclear weapons we knew in the early years of the 20th century that atoms contained a huge amount of energy we had e equals mc squared we knew the mass differences between the different atoms and their components and we knew that you might be able to make an incredibly powerful explosive so hg wells wrote science fiction book i think in 1912 frederick soddy who was the guy who discovered isotopes the nobel prize winner he gave a speech in 1915 saying that one pound of this new explosive would be the equivalent of 150 tons of dynamite which turns out to be about right and this was in world war i so he was imagining how much worse the world war would be if we were using that kind of explosive but the physics establishment simply refused to believe that these things could be made including the people who are making it well so they were doing the nuclear physics i mean eventually were the ones who made it you talk about fermi or whoever well so up to the development was mostly theoretical so it was people using sort of primitive kinds of particle acceleration and doing experiments at the level of single particles or collections of particles they werent yet thinking about how to actually make a bomb or anything like that but they knew the energy was there and they figured if they understood it better it might be possible but the physics establishment their view and i think because they did not want it to be true their view was that it could not be true that this could not not provide a way to make a super weapon and there was this famous speech given by rutherford who was the sort of leader of nuclear physics and it was on september 11th 1933 and he said anyone who talks about the possibility of obtaining energy from transformation of atoms is talking complete moonshine and the next morning leo szilard read about that speech and then invented the nuclear chain reaction and so as soon as he invented as soon as he had that idea that you could make a chain reaction with neutrons because neutrons were not repelled by the nucleus so they could enter the nucleus and then continue the reaction as soon as he has that idea he instantly realized that the world was in deep doo doo because this is 1933 right hitler had recently come to power in germany szilard was in london and eventually became a refugee and came to the us and in the process of having the idea about the chain reaction he figured out basically how to make a bomb and also how to make a reactor and he patented the reactor in 1934 but because of the situation the great power conflict situation that he could see happening he kept that a secret and so between then and the beginning of world war ii people were working including the germans on how to actually create neutron sources what specific fission reactions would produce neutrons of the right energy to continue the reaction and that was demonstrated in germany i think in 1938 if i remember correctly the first nuclear weapon patent was 1939 by the french so this was actually going on well before world war ii really got going and then the british probably had the most advanced capability in this area but for safety reasons among others and just resources they moved the program from britain to the us and then that became manhattan project so the reason why we couldnt have any kind of oversight of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology was because we were basically already in an arms race and a war lr but you mentioned then in the 20s and 30s so what are the echoes the way youve described this story i mean theres clearly echoes why do you think most ai researchers folks who are really close to the metal they really are not concerned about ai they dont think about it whether its they dont want to think about it but why do you think that is is what are the echoes of the nuclear situation to the current ai situation and what can we do about it bf i think there is a kind of motivated cognition which is a term in psychology means that you believe what you would like to be true rather than what is true and its unsettling to think that what youre working on might be the end of the human race obviously so you would rather instantly deny it and come up with some reason why it couldnt be true and i have i collected a long list of reasons that extremely intelligent competent ai scientists have come up with for why we shouldnt worry about this for example calculators are superhuman at arithmetic and they havent taken over the world so theres nothing to worry about well okay my five year old you know could have figured out why that was an unreasonable and really quite weak argument another one was while its theoretically possible that you could have superhuman ai destroy the world its also theoretically possible that a black hole could materialize right next to the earth and destroy humanity i mean yes its theoretically possible quantum theoretically extremely unlikely that it would just materialize right there but thats a completely bogus analogy because you know if the whole physics community on earth was working to materialize a black hole in near earth orbit right wouldnt you ask them is that a good idea is that going to be safe you know what if you succeed right and thats the thing right the ai community is sort of refused to ask itself what if you succeed and initially i think that was because it was too hard but you know alan turing asked himself that and he said wed be toast right if we were lucky we might be able to switch off the power but probably wed be toast but theres also an aspect that because were not exactly sure what the future holds its not clear exactly so technically what to worry about sort of how things go wrong and so there is something it feels like maybe you can correct me if im wrong but theres something paralyzing about worrying about something that logically is inevitable but you have to think about it logically is inevitable but you dont really know what that will look like yeah i think thats its a reasonable point and you know its certainly in terms of existential risks its different from you know asteroid collides with the earth right which again is quite possible you know its happened in the past itll probably happen again we dont know right now but if we did detect an asteroid that was going to hit the earth in 75 years time wed certainly be doing something about it well its clear theres got big rock and theres well probably have a meeting and see what do we do about the big rock with ai right with ai i mean there are very few people who think its not going to happen within the next 75 years i know rod brooks doesnt think its going to happen maybe andrew ng doesnt think its happened but you know a lot of the people who work day to day you know as you say at the rock face they think its going to happen i think the median estimate from ai researchers is somewhere in 40 to 50 years from now or maybe you know i think in asia they think its going to be even faster than that im a little bit more conservative i think itd probably take longer than that but i think you know as happened with nuclear weapons it can happen overnight that you have these breakthroughs and we need more than one breakthrough but you know its on the order of half a dozen i mean this is a very rough scale but sort of half a dozen breakthroughs of that nature would have to happen for us to reach the superhuman ai but the you know the ai research community is vast now the massive investments from governments from corporations tons of really really smart people you know you just have to look at the rate of progress in different areas of ai to see that things are moving pretty fast so to say oh its just going to be thousands of years i dont see any basis for that you know i see you know for example the stanford 100 year ai project right which is supposed to be sort of you know the serious establishment view their most recent report actually said its probably not even possible oh wow right which if you want a perfect example of people in denial thats it because you know for the whole history of ai weve been saying to philosophers who said it wasnt possible well you have no idea what youre talking about of course its possible right give me an argument for why it couldnt happen and there isnt one right and now because people are worried that maybe ai might get a bad name or i just dont want to think about this theyre saying okay well of course its not really possible you know imagine if you know the leaders of the cancer biology community got up and said well you know of course curing cancer its not really possible thered be complete outrage and dismay and you know i find this really a strange phenomenon so okay so if you accept that its possible and if you accept that its probably going to happen the point that youre making that you know how does it go wrong a valid question without that without an answer to that question then youre stuck with what i call the gorilla problem which is you know the problem that the gorillas face right they made something more intelligent than them namely us a few million years ago and now theyre in deep doo doo so theres really nothing they can do theyve lost the control they failed to solve the control problem of controlling humans and so theyve lost so we dont want to be in that situation and if the gorilla problem is the only formulation you have theres not a lot you can do right other than to say okay we should try to stop you know we should just not make the humans or in this case not make the ai and i think thats really hard to do im not actually proposing that thats a feasible course of action i also think that you know if properly controlled ai could be incredibly beneficial but it seems to me that theres a consensus that one of the major failure modes is this loss of control that we create ai systems that are pursuing incorrect objectives and because the ai system believes it knows what the objective is it has no incentive to listen to us anymore so to speak right its just carrying out the strategy that it has computed as being the optimal solution and you know it may be that in the process it needs to acquire more resources to increase the possibility of success or prevent various failure modes by defending itself against interference and so that collection of problems i think is something we can address the other problems are roughly speaking you know misuse right so even if we solve the control problem we make perfectly safe controllable ai systems well why you know why does dr evil going to use those right he wants to just take over the world and hell make unsafe ai systems that then get out of control so thats one problem which is sort of a you know partly a policing problem partly a sort of a cultural problem for the profession of how we teach people what kinds of ai systems are safe you talk about autonomous weapon system and how pretty much everybody agrees that theres too many ways that that can go horribly wrong this great slaughterbots movie that kind of illustrates that beautifully i want to talk about that thats another theres another topic im having to talk about i just want to mention that what i see is the third major failure mode which is overuse not so much misuse but overuse of ai that we become overly dependent so i call this the wall e problem so if youve seen wall e the movie all right all the humans are on the spaceship and the machines look after everything for them and they just watch tv and drink big gulps and theyre all sort of obese and stupid and they sort of totally lost any notion of human autonomy and you know so in effect right this would happen like the slow boiling frog right we would gradually turn over more and more of the management of our civilization to machines as we are already doing and this you know if this if this process continues you know we sort of gradually switch from sort of being the masters of technology to just being the guests right so we become guests on a cruise ship you know which is fine for a week but not not for the rest of eternity you know and its almost irreversible right once you once you lose the incentive to for example you know learn to be an engineer or a doctor or a sanitation operative or any other of the infinitely many ways that we maintain and propagate our civilization you know if you if you dont have the incentive to do any of that you wont and then its really hard to recover and of course as just one of the technologies that could that third failure mode result in that theres probably other technology in general detaches us from it does a bit but the difference is that in terms of the knowledge to to run our civilization you know up to now weve had no alternative but to put it into peoples heads right and if you software with google i mean so software in general so computers in general but but the you know the knowledge of how you know how a sanitation system works you know thats an ai has to understand that its no good putting it into google so i mean we weve always put knowledge in on paper but paper doesnt run our civilization and only runs when it goes from the paper into peoples heads again right so weve always propagated civilization through human minds and weve spent about a trillion person years doing that i literally write you you can work it out its about right theres about just over 100 billion people whove ever lived and each of them has spent about 10 years learning stuff to keep their civilization going and so thats a trillion person years we put into this effort beautiful way to describe all civilization and now were you know were in danger of throwing that away so this is a problem that ai cant solve its not a technical problem its you know if we do our job right the ai systems will say you know the human race doesnt in the long run want to be passengers in a cruise ship the human race wants autonomy this is part of human preferences so we the ai systems are not going to do this stuff for you youve got to do it for yourself right im not going to carry you to the top of everest in an autonomous helicopter you have to climb it if you want to get the benefit and so on so but im afraid that because we are short sighted and lazy were going to override the ai systems and and theres an amazing short story that i recommend to everyone that i talked to about this called the machine stops written in 1909 by em forster who you know wrote novels about the british empire and sort of things that became costume dramas on the bbc but he wrote this one science fiction story which is an amazing vision of the future it has basically ipads it has video conferencing it has moocs it has computer induced obesity i mean literally its what people spend their time doing is giving online courses or listening to online courses and talking about ideas but they never get out there in the real world they dont really have a lot of face to face contact everything is done online you know so all the things were worrying about now were described in the story and and then the human race becomes more and more dependent on the machine loses knowledge of how things really run and then becomes vulnerable to collapse and so its a its a pretty unbelievably amazing story for someone writing in 1909 to imagine all this so theres very few people that represent artificial intelligence more than you stuart russell if you say its okay thats very kind so its all my fault right youre often brought up as the person well stuart russell like the ai person is worried about this thats why you should be worried about it do you feel the burden of that i dont know if you feel that at all but when i talk to people like from you talk about people outside of computer science when they think about this stuart russell is worried about ai safety you should be worried too do you feel the burden of that i mean in a practical sense yeah because i get you know a dozen sometimes 25 invitations a day to talk about it to give interviews to write press articles and so on so in that very practical sense im seeing that people are concerned and really interested about this are you worried that you could be wrong as all good scientists are of course i worry about that all the time i mean thats thats always been the way that i ive worked you know is like i have an argument in my head with myself right so i have i have some idea and then i think okay how could that be wrong or did someone else already have that idea so ill go and you know search in as much literature as i can to see whether someone else already thought of that or or even refuted it so you know i right now im im reading a lot of philosophy because you know in in the form of the debates over over utilitarianism and and other kinds of moral moral formulas shall we say people have already thought through some of these issues but you know what one of the things im im not seeing in a lot of these debates is this specific idea about the importance of uncertainty in the objective that this is the way we should think about machines that are beneficial to humans so this idea of provably beneficial machines based on explicit uncertainty in the objective you know it seems to be you know my gut feeling is this is the core of it its going to have to be elaborated in a lot of different directions and there are a lot of beneficial yeah but there there are i mean it has to be right we cant afford you know hand wavy beneficial because there are you know whenever we do hand wavy stuff there are loopholes and the thing about super intelligent machines is they find the loopholes you know just like you know tax evaders if you dont write your tax law properly people will find the loopholes and end up paying no tax and and so you should think of it this way and and getting those definitions right you know it is really a long process you know so you can you can define mathematical frameworks and within that framework you can prove mathematical theorems that yes this will you know this this theoretical entity will be provably beneficial to that theoretical entity but that framework may not match the real world in some crucial way so its a long process thinking through it iterating and so on last question yep you have 10 seconds to answer it what is your favorite sci fi movie about ai i would say interstellar has my favorite robots oh beats space yeah yeah yeah so so tars the robots one of the robots in interstellar is the way robot should behave and uh i would say ex machina is in some ways the one the one that makes you think uh in a nervous kind of way about about where were going well stuart thank you so much for talking today pleasure so this word meta reasoning while technically correct inspires perhaps the wrong degree of power that alphago has for example the word reasoning is a powerful word so let me ask you sort of you were part of the symbolic ai world for a while like ai was theres a lot of excellent interesting ideas there that unfortunately met a winter and so do you think it reemerges so i would say yeah its not quite as simple as that so the ai winter for the first winter that was actually named as such was the one in the late 80s and that came about because in the mid 80s there was a really a concerted attempt to push ai out into the real world using what was called expert system technology and for the most part that technology was just not ready for primetime they were trying in many cases to do a form of uncertain reasoning judgment combinations of evidence diagnosis those kinds of things which was simply invalid and when you try to apply invalid reasoning methods to real problems you can fudge it for small versions of the problem but when it starts to get larger the thing just falls apart so many companies found that the stuff just didnt work and they were spending tons of money on consultants to try to make it work and there were other practical reasons like they were asking the companies to buy incredibly expensive lisp machine workstations which were literally between 50000 and 100000 in 1980s money which would be like between 150000 and 300000 per workstation in current prices and then the bottom line they werent seeing a profit from it yeah in many cases i think there were some successes theres no doubt about that but people i would say overinvested every major company was starting an ai department just like now and i worry a bit that we might see similar disappointments not because the current technology is invalid but its limited in its scope and its almost the duel of the scope problems that expert systems had so what have you learned from that hype cycle and what can we do to prevent another winter for example yeah so when im giving talks these days thats one of the warnings that i give so this is a two part warning slide one is that rather than data being the new oil data is the new snake oil thats a good line and then the other is that we might see a kind of very visible failure in some of the major application areas and i think self driving cars would be the flagship and i think when you look at the history so the first self driving car was on the freeway driving itself changing lanes overtaking in 1987 and so its more than 30 years and that kind of looks like where we are today right you know prototypes on the freeway changing lanes and overtaking now i think thats one of the things thats been made particularly on the perception side so we worked a lot on autonomous vehicles in the early mid 90s at berkeley and we had our own big demonstrations we put congressmen into self driving cars and had them zooming along the freeway and the problem was clearly perception at the time the problem was perception yeah so in simulation with perfect perception you could actually show that you can drive safely for a long time even if the other cars are misbehaving and so on but simultaneously we worked on machine vision for detecting cars and tracking pedestrians and so on and we couldnt get the cars to do that and so we had to do that for pedestrians and so on and we couldnt get the reliability of detection and tracking up to a high enough level particularly in bad weather conditions nighttime rainfall good enough for demos but perhaps not good enough to cover the general operation yeah so the thing about driving is you know suppose youre a taxi driver you know and you drive every day eight hours a day for 10 years right thats 100 million seconds of driving you know and any one of those seconds you can make a fatal mistake so youre talking about eight nines of reliability right now if your vision system only detects 983 of the vehicles right then thats sort of you know one in a bit nines of reliability so you have another seven orders of magnitude to go and this is what people dont understand they think oh because i had a successful demo im pretty much done but youre not even within seven orders of magnitude of being done and thats the difficulty and its not the can i follow a white line thats not the problem right we follow a white line all the way across the country but its the weird stuff that happens its all the edge cases yeah the edge case other drivers doing weird things you know so if you talk to google right so they had actually a very classical architecture where you know you had machine vision which would detect all the other cars and pedestrians and the white lines and the road signs and then basically that was fed into a logical database and then you had a classical 1970s rule based expert system telling you okay if youre in the middle lane and theres a bicyclist in the right lane who is signaling this then you do that right and what they found was that every day theyd go out and thered be another situation that the rules didnt cover you know so theyd come to a traffic circle and theres a little girl riding her bicycle the wrong way around the traffic circle okay what do you do we dont have a rule oh my god okay stop and then you know they come back and add more rules and they just found that this was not really converging and if you think about it right how do you deal with an unexpected situation meaning one that youve never previously encountered and the sort of reasoning required to figure out the solution for that situation has never been done it doesnt match any previous situation in terms of the kind of reasoning you have to do well you know in chess programs this happens all the time right youre constantly coming up with situations you havent seen before and you have to reason about them and you have to think about okay here are the possible things i could do here are the outcomes heres how desirable the outcomes are and then pick the right one you know in the 90s we were saying okay this is how youre going to have to do automated vehicles theyre going to have to have a look ahead capability but the look ahead for driving is more difficult than it is for chess because theres humans and theyre less predictable than chess pieces well then you have an opponent in chess whos also somewhat unpredictable but for example in chess you always know the opponents intention theyre trying to beat you right whereas in driving you dont know is this guy trying to turn left or has he just forgotten to turn off his turn signal or is he drunk or is he changing the channel on his radio or whatever it might be youve got to try and figure out the mental state the intent of the other drivers to forecast the possible evolutions of their trajectories and then youve got to figure out okay which is the trajectory for me thats going to be safest and those all interact with each other because the other drivers are going to react to your trajectory and so on so you know theyve got the classic merging onto the freeway problem where youre kind of racing a vehicle thats already on the freeway and youre going to pull ahead of them or youre going to let them go first and pull in behind and you get this sort of uncertainty about whos going first so all those kinds of things mean that you need a decision making architecture thats very different from either a rule based system or it seems to me kind of an end to end neural network system so just as alphago is pretty good when it doesnt do any look ahead but its way way way way better when it does i think the same is going to be true for driving you can have a driving system thats pretty good when it doesnt do any look ahead but thats not good enough and weve already seen multiple deaths caused by poorly designed machine learning algorithms that dont really understand what theyre doing yeah on several levels i think on the perception side theres mistakes being made by those algorithms where the perception is very shallow on the planning side the look ahead like you said and the thing that we come up against thats really interesting when you try to deploy systems in the real world is you cant think of an artificial intelligence system as a thing that responds to the world always you have to realize that its an agent that others will respond to as well so in order to drive successfully you cant just try to do obstacle avoidance right you cant pretend that youre invisible right youre the invisible car right it doesnt work that way i mean but you have to assert yet others have to be scared of you just were all theres this tension theres this game so if we study a lot of work with pedestrians if you approach pedestrians as purely an obstacle avoidance so youre doing look ahead as in modeling the intent that theyre not going to theyre going to take advantage of you theyre not going to respect you at all there has to be a tension a fear some amount of uncertainty thats how we have created or at least just a kind of a resoluteness you have to display a certain amount of resoluteness you cant be too tentative and yeah so the solutions then become pretty complicated right you get into game theoretic analyses and so at berkeley now were working a lot on this kind of interaction between machines and humans and thats exciting and so my colleague ankur dragan actually if you formulate the problem game theoretically you just let the system figure out the solution it does interesting unexpected things like sometimes at a stop sign if no one is going first the car will actually back up a little right and just to indicate to the other cars that they should go and thats something it invented entirely by itself we didnt say this is the language of communication at stop signs it figured it out thats really interesting so let me one just step back for a second just this beautiful philosophical notion so pamela mccordick in 1979 wrote ai began with the ancient wish to forge the gods so when you think about the history of our civilization do you think that there is an inherent desire to create lets not say gods but to create superintelligence is it inherent to us is it in our genes that the natural arc of human civilization is to create things that are of greater and greater power and perhaps echoes of ourselves so to create the gods as pamela said maybe i mean were all individuals but certainly we see over and over again in history individuals who thought about this possibility hopefully when im not being too philosophical here but if you look at the arc of this where this is going and well talk about ai safety well talk about greater and greater intelligence do you see that there in when you created the othello program and you felt this excitement what was that excitement was it excitement of a tinkerer who created something cool like a clock or was there a magic or was it more like a child being born yeah so i mean i certainly understand that viewpoint and if you look at the lighthill report which was so in the 70s there was a lot of controversy in the uk about ai and whether it was for real and how much money the government should invest and there was a long story but the government commissioned a report by lighthill who was a physicist and he wrote a very damning report about ai which i think was the point and he said that these are frustrated men who are unable to have children would like to create and create a life as a kind of replacement which i think is really pretty unfair but there is a kind of magic i would say when you build something and what youre building in is really just youre building in some understanding of the principles of learning and decision making and to see those principles actually then turn into intelligent behavior in specific situations its an incredible thing and that is naturally going to make you think okay where does this end and so theres magical optimistic views of where it ends whatever your view of optimism is whatever your view of utopia is its probably different for everybody but youve often talked about concerns you have of how things may go wrong so ive talked to max tegmark theres a lot of interesting ways to think about ai safety youre one of the seminal people thinking about this problem amongst sort of being in the weeds of actually solving specific ai problems youre also thinking about the big picture of where are we going so can you talk about several elements of it lets just talk about maybe the control problem so this idea of losing ability to control the behavior in our ai system so how do you see that how do you see that coming about what do you think we can do to manage it well so it doesnt take a genius to realize that if you make something thats smarter than you you might have a problem alan turing wrote about this and gave lectures about this in 1951 he did a lecture on the radio and he basically says once the machine thinking method starts very quickly theyll outstrip humanity and if were lucky we might be able to turn off the power at strategic moments but even so our species would be humbled actually he was wrong about that if its sufficiently intelligent machine its not going to let you switch it off its actually in competition with you so what do you think is most likely going to happen what do you think is meant just for a quick tangent if we shut off this super intelligent machine that our species will be humbled i think he means that we would realize that we are inferior right that we only survive by the skin of our teeth because we happen to get to the off switch just in time and if we hadnt then we would have lost control over the earth are you more worried when you think about this stuff about super intelligent ai or are you more worried about super powerful ai thats not aligned with our values so the paperclip scenarios kind of so the main problem im working on is the control problem the problem of machines pursuing objectives that are as you say not aligned with human objectives and this has been the way weve thought about ai since the beginning you build a machine for optimizing and then you put in some objective and it optimizes right and we can think of this as the king midas problem right because if the king midas put in this objective everything i touch should turn to gold and the gods thats like the machine they said okay done you now have this power and of course his father his drink and his family all turned to gold and then he dies of misery and starvation and its a warning its a failure mode that pretty much every culture in history has had some story along the same lines theres the genie that gives you three wishes and the third wish is always you know please undo the first two wishes because i messed up and when arthur samuel wrote his checker playing program which learned to play checkers considerably better than arthur samuel could play and actually reached a pretty decent standard norbert wiener who was one of the major mathematicians of the 20th century hes sort of the father of modern automation control systems he saw this and he basically extrapolated as turing did and said okay this is how we could lose control and specifically that we have to be certain that the purpose we put into the machine is the purpose which we really desire and the problem is we cant do that you mean were not its a very difficult to encode to put our values on paper is really difficult or youre just saying its impossible so theoretically its possible but in practice its extremely unlikely that we could specify correctly in advance the full range of concerns of humanity you talked about cultural transmission of values i think is how humans to human transmission of values happens right well we learn yeah i mean as we grow up we learn about the values that matter how things should go what is reasonable to pursue and what isnt reasonable to pursue you think machines can learn in the same kind of way yeah so i think that what we need to do is to get away from this idea that you build an optimising machine and then you put the objective into it because if its possible that you might put in a wrong objective and we already know this is possible because its happened lots of times right that means that the machine should never take an objective thats given as gospel truth because once it takes the objective as gospel truth then it believes that whatever actions its taking in pursuit of that objective are the correct things to do so you could be jumping up and down and saying no no no no youre going to destroy the world but the machine knows what the true objective is and is pursuing it and tough luck to you and this is not restricted to ai right this is i think many of the 20th century technologies right so in statistics you minimise a loss function the loss function is exogenously specified in control theory you minimise a cost function in operations research you maximise a reward function and so on so in all these disciplines this is how we conceive of the problem and its the wrong problem because we cannot specify with certainty the correct objective right we need uncertainty we need the machine to be uncertain about what it is that its supposed to be maximising favourite idea of yours ive heard you say somewhere well i shouldnt pick favourites but it just sounds beautiful we need to teach machines humility its a beautiful way to put it i love it that theyre humble they know that they dont know what it is theyre supposed to be doing and that those objectives i mean they exist theyre within us but we may not be able to we may not be able to explicate them we may not even know how we want our future to go exactly and the machine a machine thats uncertain is going to be deferential to us so if we say dont do that well now the machines learn something a bit more about our true objectives because something that it thought was reasonable in pursuit of our objective turns out not to be so now its learned something so its going to defer because it wants to be doing what we really want and that point i think is absolutely central to solving the control problem and its a different kind of ai when you take away this idea that the objective is known then in fact a lot of the theoretical frameworks that were so familiar with you know markov decision processes goal based planning you know standard games research all of these techniques actually become inapplicable and you get a more complicated problem because now the interaction with the human becomes part of the problem because the human by making choices is giving you more information about the true objective and that information helps you achieve the objective better and so that really means that youre mostly dealing with game theoretic problems where youve got the machine and the human and theyre coupled together rather than a machine going off by itself with a fixed objective lw which is fascinating on the machine and the human level that we when you dont have an objective means youre together coming up with an objective i mean theres a lot of philosophy that you know you could argue that life doesnt really have meaning we together agree on what gives it meaning and we kind of culturally create things that give why the heck we are on this earth anyway we together as a society create that meaning and you have to learn that objective and one of the biggest i thought thats where you were going to go for a second one of the biggest troubles we run into outside of statistics and machine learning and ai and just human civilization is when you look at i came from i was born in the soviet union and the history of the 20th century we ran into the most trouble us humans when there was a certainty about the objective and you do whatever it takes to achieve that objective whether youre talking about germany or communist russia you get into trouble with humans i would say with you know corporations in fact some people argue that you know we dont have to look forward to a time when ai systems take over the world they already have and they call corporations right that corporations happen to be using people as components right now but they are effectively algorithmic machines and theyre optimizing an objective which is quarterly profit that isnt aligned with overall wellbeing of the human race and they are destroying the world they are primarily responsible for our inability to tackle climate change so i think thats one way of thinking about whats going on with corporations but i think the point youre making is valid that there are many systems in the real world where weve sort of prematurely fixed on the objective and then decoupled the machine from those thats supposed to be serving and i think you see this with government right government is supposed to be a machine that serves people but instead it tends to be taken over by people who have their own objective and use government to optimize that objective regardless of what people want do you find appealing the idea of almost arguing machines where you have multiple ai systems with a clear fixed objective we have in government the red team and the blue team theyre very fixed on their objectives and they argue and they kind of may disagree but it kind of seems to make it work somewhat that the duality of it okay lets go a hundred years back when there was still was going on or at the founding of this country there was disagreements and that disagreement is where so it was a balance between certainty and forced humility because the power was distributed yeah i think that the nature of debate and disagreement argument takes as a premise the idea that you could be wrong which means that youre not necessarily absolutely convinced that your objective is the correct one if you were absolutely convinced thered be no point in having any discussion or argument because you would never change your mind and there wouldnt be any sort of synthesis or anything like that i think you can think of argumentation as an implementation of a form of uncertain reasoning ive been reading recently about utilitarianism and the history of efforts to define in a sort of clear mathematical way if you like a formula for moral or political decision making its really interesting that the parallels between the philosophical discussions going back 200 years and what you see now in discussions about existential risk because its almost exactly the same someone would say okay well heres a formula for how we should make decisions utilitarianism is roughly each person has a utility function and then we make decisions to maximize the sum of everybodys utility then people point out well in that case the best policy is one that leads to the enormously vast population all of whom are living a life thats barely worth living this is called the repugnant conclusion another version is that we should maximize pleasure and thats what we mean by utility then youll get people effectively saying well in that case we might as well just have everyone hooked up to a heroin drip they didnt use those words but that debate was happening in the 19th century as it is now about ai that if we get the formula wrong were going to have ai systems working towards an outcome that in retrospect would be exactly wrong do you think theres as beautifully put so the echoes are there but do you think i mean if you look at sam harris our imagination worries about the ai version of that because of the speed at which the things going wrong in the utilitarian context could happen is that a worry for you yeah i think that in most cases not in all but if we have a wrong political idea we see it starting to go wrong and were not completely stupid and so we say okay maybe that was a mistake lets try something different also were very slow and inefficient about implementing these things and so on so you have to worry when you have corporations or political systems that are extremely efficient but when we look at ai systems or even just computers in general they have this different characteristic from ordinary human activity in the past so lets say you were a surgeon you had some idea about how to do some operation well and lets say you were wrong that way of doing the operation would mostly kill the patient well youd find out pretty quickly like after three maybe three or four tries but that isnt true for pharmaceutical companies because they dont do three or four operations they manufacture three or four billion pills and they sell them and then they find out maybe six months or a year later that oh people are dying of heart attacks or getting cancer from this drug and so thats why we have the fda right because of the scalability of pharmaceutical production and there have been some unbelievably bad episodes in the history of pharmaceuticals and adulteration of products and so on that have killed tens of thousands or paralyzed hundreds of thousands of people now with computers we have that same scalability problem that you can sit there and type for i equals one to five billion do right and all of a sudden youre having an impact on a global scale and yet we have no fda right theres absolutely no controls at all over what a bunch of undergraduates with too much caffeine can do to the world and we look at what happened with facebook well social media in general and click through optimization so you have a simple feedback algorithm thats trying to just optimize click through right that sounds reasonable right because you dont want to be feeding people ads that they dont care about or not interested in and you might even think of that process as simply adjusting the feeding of ads or news articles or whatever it might be to match peoples preferences right which sounds like a good idea but in fact that isnt how the algorithm works right you make more money the algorithm makes more money if it can better predict what people are going to click on because then it can feed them exactly that right so the way to maximize click through is actually to modify the people to make them more predictable and one way to do that is to feed them information which will change their behavior and preferences towards extremes that make them predictable whatever is the nearest extreme or the nearest predictable point thats where youre going to end up and the machines will force you there and i think theres a reasonable argument to say that this among other things is contributing to the destruction of democracy in the world and where was the oversight of this process where were the people saying okay you would like to apply this algorithm to 5 billion people on the face of the earth can you show me that its safe can you show me that it wont have various kinds of negative effects no there was no one asking that question there was no one placed between the undergrads with too much caffeine and the human race they just did it but some way outside the scope of my knowledge so economists would argue that the what is it the invisible hand so the capitalist system it was the oversight so if youre going to corrupt society with whatever decision you make as a company then thats going to be reflected in people not using your product thats one model of oversight we shall see but in the meantime but you might even have broken the political system that enables capitalism to function well youve changed it we shall see change is often painful so my question is absolutely its fascinating youre absolutely right that there was zero oversight on algorithms that can have a profound civilization changing effect so do you think its possible i mean i havent have you seen government so do you think its possible to create regulatory bodies oversight over ai algorithms which are inherently such cutting edge set of ideas and technologies yeah but i think it takes time to figure out what kind of oversight what kinds of controls i mean it took time to design the fda regime you know and some people still dont like it and they want to fix it and i think there are clear ways that it could be improved but the whole notion that you have stage one stage two stage three and here are the criteria for what you have to do to pass a stage one trial right we havent even thought about what those would be for algorithms so i mean i think there are things we could do right now with regard to bias for example we have a pretty good technical handle on how to detect algorithms that are propagating bias that exists in data sets how to de bias those algorithms and even what its going to cost you to do that so i think we could start having some standards on that i think there are things to do with impersonation and falsification that we could work on fakes yeah a very simple point so impersonation is a machine acting as if it was a person i cant see a real justification for why we shouldnt insist that machines self identify as machines where is the social benefit in fooling people into thinking that this is really a person when it isnt i dont mind if it uses a human like voice thats easy to understand thats fine but it should just say im a machine in some form and how many people are speaking to that i would think relatively obvious facts yeah i mean there is actually a law in california that bans impersonation but only in certain restricted circumstances so for the purpose of engaging in a fraudulent transaction and for the purpose of modifying someones voting behavior so those are the circumstances where machines have to self identify but i think arguably it should be in all circumstances and then when you talk about deep fakes were just at the beginning but already its possible to make a movie of anybody saying anything in ways that are pretty hard to detect',\n",
       " 'the following is a conversation with peter abbeel hes a professor at uc berkeley and the director of the berkeley robotics learning lab hes one of the top researchers in the world working on how we make robots understand and interact with the world around them especially using imitation and deep reinforcement learning this conversation is part of the mit course on artificial general intelligence and the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it please subscribe on youtube itunes or your podcast provider of choice or simply connect with me on twitter at lex friedman spelled f r i d and now heres my conversation with peter abbeel youve mentioned that if there was one person you could meet it would be roger federer so let me ask when do you think well have a robot that fully autonomously can beat roger federer at tennis roger federer level player at tennis well first if you can make it happen for me to meet roger let me know in terms of getting a robot to beat him at tennis its kind of an interesting question because for a lot of the challenges we think about in ai the software is really the missing piece but for something like this the hardware is nowhere near either to really have a robot that can physically run around the boston dynamics robots are starting to get there but still not really human level ability to run around and then swing a racket so you think thats a hardware problem i dont think its a hardware problem only i think its a hardware and a software problem i think its both and i think theyll have independent progress so id say the hardware maybe in 10 15 years on clay not grass i mean grass is probably harder with the sliding yeah with the clay im not sure whats harder grass or clay the clay involves sliding which might be harder to master actually yeah but youre not limited to a bipedal i mean im sure theres no well if we can build a machine its a whole different question of course if you can say okay this robot can be on wheels it can move around on wheels and can be designed differently then i think that can be done sooner probably than a full humanoid type of setup what do you think of swing a racket so youve worked at basic manipulation how hard do you think is the task of swinging a racket would be able to hit a nice backhand or a forehand lets say we just set up stationary a nice robot arm lets say a standard industrial arm and it can watch the ball come and then swing the racket its a good question im not sure it would be super hard to do i mean im sure it would require a lot if we do it with reinforcement learning it would require a lot of trial and error its not gonna swing it right the first time around but yeah i dont see why i couldnt swing it the right way i think its learnable i think if you set up a ball machine lets say on one side and then a robot with a tennis racket on the other side i think its learnable and maybe a little bit of pre training and simulation yeah i think thats feasible i think the swing the racket is feasible itd be very interesting to see how much precision it can get cause i mean thats where i mean some of the human players can hit it on the lines which is very high precision with spin the spin is an interesting whether rl can learn to put a spin on the ball well you got me interested maybe someday well set this up sure you got me intrigued your answer is basically okay for this problem it sounds fascinating but for the general problem of a tennis player we might be a little bit farther away whats the most impressive thing youve seen a robot do in the physical world so physically for me its the boston dynamics videos always just bring home and just super impressed recently the robot running up the stairs doing the parkour type thing i mean yes we dont know whats underneath they dont really write a lot of detail but even if its hard coded underneath which it might or might not be just the physical abilities of doing that parkour thats a very impressive so have you met spot mini or any of those robots in person met spot mini last year in april at the mars event that jeff bezos organizes they brought it out there and it was nicely following around jeff when jeff left the room they had it follow him along which is pretty impressive so i think theres some confidence to know that theres no learning going on in those robots the psychology of it so while knowing that while knowing theres not if theres any learning going on its very limited i met spot mini earlier this year and knowing everything thats going on having one on one interaction so i got to spend some time alone and theres immediately a deep connection on the psychological level even though you know the fundamentals how it works theres something magical so do you think about the psychology of interacting with robots in the physical world even you just showed me the pr2 the robot and there was a little bit something like a face had a little bit something like a face theres something that immediately draws you to it do you think about that aspect of the robotics problem well its very hard with brad here well give him a name berkeley robot for the elimination of tedious tasks its very hard to not think of the robot as a person and it seems like everybody calls him a he for whatever reason but that also makes it more a person than if it was a it and it seems pretty natural to think of it that way this past weekend really struck me ive seen pepper many times on videos but then i was at an event organized by this was by fidelity and they had scripted pepper to help moderate some sessions and they had scripted pepper to have the personality of a child a little bit and it was very hard to not think of it as its own person in some sense because it would just jump in the conversation making it very interactive moderate would be saying pepper would just jump in hold on how about me can i participate in this too and youre just like okay this is like a person and that was 100 scripted and even then it was hard not to have that sense of somehow there is something there so as we have robots interact in this physical world is that a signal that could be used in reinforcement learning youve worked a little bit in this direction but do you think that psychology can be somehow pulled in yes thats a question i would say a lot of people ask and i think part of why they ask it is theyre thinking about how unique are we really still as people like after they see some results they see a computer play go they see a computer do this that theyre like okay but can it really have emotion can it really interact with us in that way and then once youre around robots you already start feeling it and i think that kind of maybe mythologically the way that i think of it is if you run something like reinforcement learning its about optimizing some objective and theres no reason that the objective couldnt be tied into how much does a person like interacting with this system and why could not the reinforcement learning system optimize for the robot being fun to be around and why wouldnt it then naturally become more and more interactive and more and more maybe like a person or like a pet i dont know what it would exactly be but more and more have those features and acquire them automatically as long as you can formalize an objective of what it means to like something what how you exhibit whats the ground truth how do you get the reward from human because you have to somehow collect that information within you human but youre saying if you can formulate as an objective it can be learned theres no reason it couldnt emerge through learning and maybe one way to formulate as an objective you wouldnt have to necessarily score it explicitly so standard rewards are numbers and numbers are hard to come by this is a 15 or a 17 on some scale its very hard to do for a person but much easier is for a person to say okay what you did the last five minutes was much nicer than what you did the previous five minutes and that now gives a comparison and in fact there have been some results on that for example paul christiano and collaborators at openai had the hopper mojoko hopper a one legged robot going through backflips purely from feedback i like this better than that thats kind of equally good and after a bunch of interactions it figured out what it was the person was asking for namely a backflip and so i think the same thing oh it wasnt trying to do a backflip it was just getting a comparison score from the person based on person having in mind in their own mind i wanted to do a backflip but the robot didnt know what it was supposed to be doing it just knew that sometimes the person said this is better this is worse and then the robot figured out what the person was actually after was a backflip and id imagine the same would be true for things like more interactive robots that the robot would figure out over time oh this kind of thing apparently is appreciated more than this other kind of thing so when i first picked up suttons richard suttons reinforcement learning book before sort of this deep learning before the reemergence of neural networks as a powerful mechanism for machine learning rl seemed to me like magic it was beautiful so that seemed like what intelligence is rl reinforcement learning so how do you think we can possibly learn anything about the world when the reward for the actions is delayed is so sparse like where is why do you think rl works why do you think you can learn anything under such sparse rewards whether its regular reinforcement learning or deep reinforcement learning whats your intuition the counterpart of that is why is rl why does it need so many samples so many experiences to learn from because really whats happening is when you have a sparse reward you do something maybe for like i dont know you take 100 actions and then you get a reward and maybe you get like a score of three and im like okay three not sure what that means you go again and now you get two and now you know that that sequence of 100 actions that you did the second time around somehow was worse than the sequence of 100 actions you did the first time around but thats tough to now know which one of those were better or worse some might have been good and bad in either one and so thats why it needs so many experiences but once you have enough experiences effectively rl is teasing that apart its trying to say okay what is consistently there when you get a higher reward and whats consistently there when you get a lower reward and then kind of the magic of sometimes the policy gradient update is to say now lets update the neural network to make the actions that were kind of present when things are good more likely and make the actions that are present when things are not as good less likely so that is the counterpoint but it seems like you would need to run it a lot more than you do even though right now people could say that rl is very inefficient but it seems to be way more efficient than one would imagine on paper that the simple updates to the policy the policy gradient that somehow you can learn exactly you just said what are the common actions that seem to produce some good results that that somehow can learn anything it seems counterintuitive at least is there some intuition behind it yeah so i think theres a few ways to think about this the way i tend to think about it mostly originally so when we started working on deep reinforcement learning here at berkeley which was maybe 2011 12 13 around that time john schulman was a phd student initially kind of driving it forward here and the way we thought about it at the time was if you think about rectified linear units or kind of rectifier type neural networks what do you get you get something thats piecewise linear feedback control and if you look at the literature linear feedback control is extremely successful can solve many many problems surprisingly well i remember for example when we did helicopter flight if youre in a stationary flight regime not a non stationary but a stationary flight regime like hover you can use linear feedback control to stabilize a helicopter very complex dynamical system but the controller is relatively simple and so i think thats a big part of it is that if you do feedback control even though the system you control can be very very complex often relatively simple control architectures can already do a lot but then also just linear is not good enough and so one way you can think of these neural networks is that sometimes they tile the space which people were already trying to do more by hand or with finite state machines say this linear controller here this linear controller here neural network learns to tile the space and say linear controller here another linear controller here but its more subtle than that and so its benefiting from this linear control aspect its benefiting from the tiling but its somehow tiling it one dimension at a time because if lets say you have a two layer network if in that hidden layer you make a transition from active to inactive or the other way around that is essentially one axis but not axis aligned but one direction that you change and so you have this kind of very gradual tiling of the space where you have a lot of sharing between the linear controllers that tile the space and that was always my intuition as to why to expect that this might work pretty well its essentially leveraging the fact that linear feedback control is so good but of course not enough and this is a gradual tiling of the space with linear feedback controls that share a lot of expertise across them so thats really nice intuition but do you think that scales to the more and more general problems of when you start going up the number of dimensions when you start going down in terms of how often you get a clean reward signal does that intuition carry forward to those crazier weirder worlds that we think of as the real world so i think where things get really tricky in the real world compared to the things weve looked at so far with great success in reinforcement learning is the time scales which takes us to an extreme so when you think about the real world i mean i dont know maybe some student decided to do a phd here right okay thats a decision thats a very high level decision but if you think about their lives i mean any persons life its a sequence of muscle fiber contractions and relaxations and thats how you interact with the world and thats a very high frequency control thing but its ultimately what you do and how you affect the world until i guess we have brain readings and you can maybe do it slightly differently but typically thats how you affect the world and the decision of doing a phd is so abstract relative to what youre actually doing in the world and i think thats where credit assignment becomes just completely beyond what any current rl algorithm can do and we need hierarchical reasoning at a level that is just not available at all yet where do you think we can pick up hierarchical reasoning by which mechanisms yeah so maybe let me highlight what i think the limitations are of what already was done 20 30 years ago in fact youll find reasoning systems that reason over relatively long horizons but the problem is that they were not grounded in the real world so people would have to hand design some kind of logical dynamical descriptions of the world and that didnt tie into perception and so it didnt tie into real objects and so forth and so that was a big gap now with deep learning we start having the ability to really see with sensors process that and understand whats in the world and so its a good time to try to bring these things together i see a few ways of getting there one way to get there would be to say deep learning can get bolted on somehow to some of these more traditional approaches now bolted on would probably mean you need to do some kind of end to end training where you say my deep learning processing somehow leads to a representation that in term uses some kind of traditional underlying dynamical systems that can be used for planning and thats for example the direction aviv tamar and thanard kuretach here have been pushing with causal info again and of course other people too thats one way can we somehow force it into the form factor that is amenable to reasoning another direction weve been thinking about for a long time and didnt make any progress on was more information theoretic approaches so the idea there was that what it means to take high level action is to take and choose a latent variable now that tells you a lot about whats gonna be the case in the future because thats what it means to take a high level action i say okay i decide im gonna navigate to the gas station because i need to get gas for my car well thatll now take five minutes to get there but the fact that i get there i could already tell that from the high level action i took much earlier that we had a very hard time getting success with not saying its a dead end necessarily but we had a lot of trouble getting that to work and then we started revisiting the notion of what are we really trying to achieve what were trying to achieve is not necessarily hierarchy per se but you could think about what does hierarchy give us what we hope it would give us is better credit assignment what is better credit assignment its giving us it gives us faster learning right and so faster learning is ultimately maybe what were after and so thats where we ended up with the rl squared paper on learning to reinforcement learn which at a time rocky dwan led and thats exactly the meta learning approach where you say okay we dont know how to design hierarchy we know what we want to get from it lets just enter and optimize for what we want to get from it and see if it might emerge and we saw things emerge the maze navigation had consistent motion down hallways which is what you want a hierarchical control should say i want to go down this hallway and then when there is an option to take a turn i can decide whether to take a turn or not and repeat even had the notion of where have you been before or not to not revisit places youve been before it still didnt scale yet to the real world kind of scenarios i think you had in mind but it was some sign of life that maybe you can meta learn these hierarchical concepts i mean it seems like through these meta learning concepts get at the what i think is one of the hardest and most important problems of ai which is transfer learning so its generalization how far along this journey towards building general systems are we being able to do transfer learning well so theres some signs that you can generalize a little bit but do you think were on the right path or its totally different breakthroughs are needed to be able to transfer knowledge between different learned models yeah im pretty torn on this in that i think there are some very impressive well theres just some very impressive results already i mean i would say when even with the initial kind of big breakthrough in 2012 with alexnet the initial thing is okay great this does better on imagenet hence image recognition but then immediately thereafter there was of course the notion that wow what was learned on imagenet and you now wanna solve a new task you can fine tune alexnet for new tasks and that was often found to be the even bigger deal that you learn something that was reusable which was not often the case before usually machine learning you learn something for one scenario and that was it and thats really exciting i mean thats a huge application thats probably the biggest success of transfer learning today in terms of scope and impact that was a huge breakthrough and then recently i feel like similar kind of by scaling things up it seems like this has been expanded upon like people training even bigger networks they might transfer even better if you looked at for example some of the openai results on language models and some of the recent google results on language models theyre learned for just prediction and then they get reused for other tasks and so i think there is something there where somehow if you train a big enough model on enough things it seems to transfer some deep mind results that i thought were very impressive the unreal results where it was learned to navigate mazes in ways where it wasnt just doing reinforcement learning but it had other objectives it was optimizing for so i think theres a lot of interesting results already i think maybe where its hard to wrap my head around this to which extent or when do we call something generalization or the levels of generalization in the real world or the levels of generalization involved in these different tasks right you draw this by the way just to frame things ive heard you say somewhere its the difference between learning to master versus learning to generalize that its a nice line to think about and i guess youre saying that its a gray area of what learning to master and learning to generalize where one starts i think i might have heard this i might have heard it somewhere else and i think it mightve been one of your interviews maybe the one with yoshua benjamin im not 100 sure but i liked the example im not sure who it was but the example was essentially if you use current deep learning techniques what were doing to predict lets say the relative motion of our planets it would do pretty well but then now if a massive new mass enters our solar system it would probably not predict what will happen right and thats a different kind of generalization thats a generalization that relies on the ultimate simplest simplest explanation that we have available today to explain the motion of planets whereas just pattern recognition could predict our current solar system motion pretty well no problem and so i think thats an example of a kind of generalization that is a little different from what weve achieved so far and its not clear if just regularizing more and forcing it to come up with a simpler simpler simpler explanation and say look this is not simple but thats what physics researchers do right they say can i make this even simpler how simple can i get this whats the simplest equation that can explain everything the master equation for the entire dynamics of the universe we havent really pushed that direction as hard in deep learning i would say not sure if it should be pushed but it seems a kind of generalization you get from that that you dont get in our current methods so far so i just talked to vladimir vapnik for example whos a statistician of statistical learning and he kind of dreams of creating the e equals mc squared for learning right the general theory of learning do you think thats a fruitless pursuit in the near term within the next several decades i think thats a really interesting pursuit in the following sense in that there is a lot of evidence that the brain is pretty modular and so i wouldnt maybe think of it as the theory maybe the underlying theory but more kind of the principle where there have been findings where people who are blind will use the part of the brain usually used for vision for other functions and even after some kind of if people get rewired in some way they might be able to reuse parts of their brain for other functions and so what that suggests is some kind of modularity and i think it is a pretty natural thing to strive for to see can we find that modularity can we find this thing of course every part of the brain is not exactly the same not everything can be rewired arbitrarily but if you think of things like the neocortex which is a pretty big part of the brain that seems fairly modular from what the findings so far can you design something equally modular and if you can just grow it it becomes more capable probably i think that would be the kind of interesting underlying principle to shoot for that is not unrealistic do you think you prefer math or empirical trial and error for the discovery of the essence of what it means to do something intelligent so reinforcement learning embodies both groups right to prove that something converges prove the bounds and then at the same time a lot of those successes are well lets try this and see if it works so which do you gravitate towards how do you think of those two parts of your brain maybe i would prefer we could make the progress with mathematics and the reason maybe i would prefer that is because often if you have something you can mathematically formalize you can leapfrog a lot of experimentation and experimentation takes a long time to get through and a lot of trial and error kind of reinforcement learning your research process but you need to do a lot of trial and error before you get to a success so if you can leapfrog that to my mind thats what the math is about and hopefully once you do a bunch of experiments you start seeing a pattern you can do some derivations that leapfrog some experiments but i agree with you i mean in practice a lot of the progress has been such that we have not been able to find the math that allows you to leapfrog ahead and we are kind of making gradual progress one step at a time a new experiment here a new experiment there that gives us new insights and gradually building up but not getting to something yet where were just okay heres an equation that now explains how you know that would be have been two years of experimentation to get there but this tells us what the results going to be unfortunately not so much yet not so much yet but your hope is there in trying to teach robots or systems to do everyday tasks or even in simulation what do you think youre more excited about imitation learning or self play so letting robots learn from humans or letting robots plan their own to try to figure out in their own way and eventually play eventually interact with humans or solve whatever the problem is whats the more exciting to you whats more promising you think as a research direction so when we look at self play whats so beautiful about it is goes back to kind of the challenges in reinforcement learning so the challenge of reinforcement learning is getting signal and if you dont never succeed you dont get any signal in self play youre on both sides so one of you succeeds and the beauty is also one of you fails and so you see the contrast you see the one version of me that did better than the other version so every time you play yourself you get signal and so whenever you can turn something into self play youre in a beautiful situation where you can naturally learn much more quickly than in most other reinforcement learning environments so i think if somehow we can turn more reinforcement learning problems into self play formulations that would go really really far so far self play has been largely around games where there is natural opponents but if we could do self play for other things and lets say i dont know a robot learns to build a house i mean thats a pretty advanced thing to try to do for a robot but maybe it tries to build a hut or something if that can be done through self play it would learn a lot more quickly if somebody can figure that out and i think that would be something where it goes closer to kind of the mathematical leapfrogging where somebody figures out a formalism to say okay any rl problem by playing this and this idea you can turn it into a self play problem where you get signal a lot more easily reality is many problems we dont know how to turn into self play and so either we need to provide detailed reward that doesnt just reward for achieving a goal but rewards for making progress and that becomes time consuming and once youre starting to do that lets say you want a robot to do something you need to give all this detailed reward well why not just give a demonstration because why not just show the robot and now the question is how do you show the robot one way to show is to tally operate the robot and then the robot really experiences things and thats nice because thats really high signal to noise ratio data and weve done a lot of that and you teach your robot skills in just 10 minutes you can teach your robot a new basic skill like okay pick up the bottle place it somewhere else thats a skill no matter where the bottle starts maybe it always goes onto a target or something thats fairly easy to teach your robot with tally up now whats even more interesting if you can now teach your robot through third person learning where the robot watches you do something and doesnt experience it but just kind of watches you it doesnt experience it but just watches it and says okay well if youre showing me that that means i should be doing this and im not gonna be using your hand because i dont get to control your hand but im gonna use my hand i do that mapping and so thats where i think one of the big breakthroughs has happened this year this was led by chelsea finn here its almost like learning a machine translation for demonstrations where you have a human demonstration and the robot learns to translate it into what it means for the robot to do it and that was a meta learning formulation learn from one to get the other and that i think opens up a lot of opportunities to learn a lot more quickly so my focus is on autonomous vehicles do you think this approach of third person watching the autonomous driving is amenable to this kind of approach so for autonomous driving i would say third person is slightly easier and the reason im gonna say its slightly easier to do with third person is because the car dynamics are very well understood so the easier than first person you mean or easier than so i think the distinction between third person and first person is not a very important distinction for autonomous driving theyre very similar because the distinction is really about who turns the steering wheel or maybe let me put it differently how to get from a point where you are now to a point lets say a couple meters in front of you and thats a problem thats very well understood and thats the only distinction between third and first person there whereas with the robot manipulation interaction forces are very complex and its still a very different thing for autonomous driving i think there is still the question imitation versus rl so imitation gives you a lot more signal i think where imitation is lacking and needs some extra machinery is it doesnt in its normal format doesnt think about goals or objectives and of course there are versions of imitation learning and versus reinforcement learning type imitation learning which also thinks about goals i think then were getting much closer but i think its very hard to think of a fully reactive car generalizing well if it really doesnt have a notion of objectives to generalize well to the kind of general that you would want youd want more than just that reactivity that you get from just behavioral cloning slash supervised learning so a lot of the work whether its self play or even imitation learning would benefit significantly from simulation from effective simulation and youre doing a lot of stuff in the physical world and in simulation do you have hope for greater and greater power of simulation being boundless eventually to where most of what we need to operate in the physical world could be simulated to a degree thats directly transferable to the physical world or are we still very far away from that so i think we could even rephrase that question in some sense please and so the power of simulation right as simulators get better and better of course becomes stronger and we can learn more in simulation but theres also another version which is where you say the simulator doesnt even have to be that precise as long as its somewhat representative and instead of trying to get one simulator that is sufficiently precise to learn in and transfer really well to the real world im gonna build many simulators ensemble of simulators ensemble of simulators not any single one of them is sufficiently representative of the real world such that it would work if you train in there but if you train in all of them then there is something thats good in all of them the real world will just be another one of them thats not identical to any one of them but just another one of them another sample from the distribution of simulators exactly we do live in a simulation so this is just one other one im not sure about that but yeah its definitely a very advanced simulator if it is yeah its a pretty good one ive talked to stuart russell its something you think about a little bit too of course youre really trying to build these systems but do you think about the future of ai a lot of people have concern about safety how do you think about ai safety as you build robots that are operating in the physical world what is yeah how do you approach this problem in an engineering kind of way in a systematic way so when a robot is doing things you kind of have a few notions of safety to worry about one is that the robot is physically strong and of course could do a lot of damage same for cars which we can think of as robots too in some way and this could be completely unintentional so it could be not the kind of longterm ai safety concerns that okay ai is smarter than us and now what do we do but it could be just very practical okay this robot if it makes a mistake what are the results going to be of course simulation comes in a lot there to test in simulation its a difficult question and im always wondering like i always wonder lets say you look at lets go back to driving because a lot of people know driving well of course what do we do to test somebody for driving right get a drivers license what do they really do i mean you fill out some tests and then you drive and i mean its suburban california that driving test is just you drive around the block pull over you do a stop sign successfully and then you pull over again and youre pretty much done and youre like okay if a self driving car did that would you trust it that it can drive and id be like no thats not enough for me to trust it but somehow for humans weve figured out that somebody being able to do that is representative of them being able to do a lot of other things and so i think somehow for humans we figured out representative tests of what it means if you can do this what you can really do of course testing humans humans dont wanna be tested at all times self driving cars or robots could be tested more often probably you can have replicas that get tested that are known to be identical because they use the same neural net and so forth but still i feel like we dont have this kind of unit tests or proper tests for robots and i think theres something very interesting to be thought about there especially as you update things your software improves you have a better self driving car suite you update it how do you know its indeed more capable on everything than what you had before that you didnt have any bad things creep into it so i think thats a very interesting direction of research that there is no real solution yet except that somehow for humans we do because we say okay you have a driving test you passed you can go on the road now and humans have accidents every like a million or 10 million miles something pretty phenomenal compared to that short test that is being done so let me ask youve mentioned that andrew ng by example showed you the value of kindness do you think the space of policies good policies for humans and for ai is populated by policies that with kindness or ones that are the opposite exploitation even evil so if you just look at the sea of policies we operate under as human beings or if ai system had to operate in this real world do you think its really easy to find policies that are full of kindness like we naturally fall into them or is it like a very hard optimization problem i mean there is kind of two optimizations happening for humans right so for humans theres kind of the very long term optimization which evolution has done for us and were kind of predisposed to like certain things and thats in some sense what makes our learning easier because i mean we know things like pain and hunger and thirst and the fact that we know about those is not something that we were taught thats kind of innate when were hungry were unhappy when were thirsty were unhappy when we have pain were unhappy and ultimately evolution built that into us to think about those things and so i think there is a notion that it seems somehow humans evolved in general to prefer to get along in some ways but at the same time also to be very territorial and kind of centric to their own tribe like it seems like thats the kind of space we converged onto i mean im not an expert in anthropology but it seems like were very kind of good within our own tribe but need to be taught to be nice to other tribes well if you look at steven pinker he highlights this pretty nicely in better angels of our nature where he talks about violence decreasing over time consistently so whatever tension whatever teams we pick it seems that the long arc of history goes towards us getting along more and more so i hope so so do you think that do you think its possible to teach rl based robots this kind of kindness this kind of ability to interact with humans this kind of policy even to let me ask a fun one do you think its possible to teach rl based robot to love a human being and to inspire that human to love the robot back so to like rl based algorithm that leads to a happy marriage thats an interesting question maybe ill answer it with another question right because i mean but ill come back to it so another question you can have is okay i mean how close does some peoples happiness get from interacting with just a really nice dog like i mean dogs you come home thats what dogs do they greet you theyre excited makes you happy when you come home to your dog youre just like okay this is exciting theyre always happy when im here and if they dont greet you cause maybe whatever your partner took them on a trip or something you might not be nearly as happy when you get home right and so the kind of it seems like the level of reasoning a dog has is pretty sophisticated but then its still not yet at the level of human reasoning and so it seems like we dont even need to achieve human level reasoning to get like very strong affection with humans and so my thinking is why not right why couldnt with an ai couldnt we achieve the kind of level of affection that humans feel among each other or with friendly animals and so forth so question is it a good thing for us or not thats another thing right because i mean but i dont see why not why not yeah so elon musk says love is the answer maybe he should say love is the objective function and then rl is the answer right well maybe oh peter thank you so much i dont want to take up more of your time thank you so much for talking today well thanks for coming by great to have you visit']"

second life 30 hes truly box thinker fun personality really enjoy talking youd like see videos future please subscribe also click little bell icon make sure dont miss videos also twitter linkedin agimitedu wanna watch lectures conversations like one better yet go read maxs book life 30 chapter seven goals favorite really philosophy engineering come together opens quote dostoevsky mystery human existence lies staying alive finding something live lastly believe every failure rewards us opportunity learn sense ive fortunate fail many new exciting ways conversation different ive learned something called radio frequency interference rfi look apparently music conversations local radio stations bleed audio youre recording way almost completely ruins audio exceptionally difficult sound source remove ive gotten opportunity learn avoid rfi future recording sessions ive also gotten opportunity learn use adobe audition izotope rx 6 noise audio repair course exceptionally difficult noise remove engineer im audio engineer neither anybody else group best nevertheless thank patience hope youre still able enjoy conversation think theres intelligent life universe lets open easy question minority view actually give public lectures often ask show hands thinks theres intelligent life somewhere else almost everyone put hands ask theyll like oh theres many galaxies theres gotta im numbers nerd right look carefully clear talk universe first dont mean space actually mean dont know throw universe want behind simply mean spherical region space light time reach us far 148 billion year 138 billion years since big bang theres space call universe thats access intelligent life thats gotten point building telescopes computers guess actually probability happening given planet number dont know know number cant super high theres billion earth like planets milky way galaxy alone many billions years older earth aside ufo believers isnt much evidence superduran civilization come thats famous fermi paradox right work numbers find clue probability getting life given planet could 10 minus 10 10 minus 20 10 minus two power 10 sort equally likely wanna really open minded translates equally likely nearest neighbor 10 16 meters away 10 17 meters away 10 18 time get much less 10 16 already pretty much know nothing else close get beyond 10 would discovered us yeah would discovered long ago theyre really close would probably noted engineering projects theyre beyond 10 26 meters thats already outside guess actually life thats gotten point building advanced tech think puts lot responsibility shoulders screw think people take granted okay us screw accidental nuclear war go extinct somehow theres sort star trek like situation life forms gonna come bail us doesnt matter much think theyre leveling us false sense security think much prudent say lets really grateful amazing opportunity weve make best case us physics perspective think intelligent life unique sort statistical view size universe basic matter universe difficult intelligent life come kind advanced tech building life implied statement really difficult create something like human species well think know going life life level tech theres sort two going beyond actually settling whole universe life theres major roadblock great filter sometimes called tough get either roadblock either behind us front us im hoping much behind us im super excited every time get new report nasa saying failed find life mars im like yes awesome suggests hard part maybe getting first ribosome low level kind stepping stone home free thats true future really limited imagination would much suckier turns level life kind dime dozen maybe theres problem like soon civilization gets advanced technology within hundred years get stupid fight poof would bummer yeah youve explored mysteries universe cosmological universe one thats sitting us today think youve also begun explore universe sort mystery mysterious universe mind intelligence intelligent life common thread interest way think space intelligence oh yeah teenager already fascinated biggest questions felt two biggest mysteries science universe universe quite natural spent quarter century career thinking lot one im indulging luxury research one cool feel time ripe trans greatly deepening understanding start exploring one yeah think lot people view intelligence something mysterious exist biological organisms like us therefore dismiss talk artificial general intelligence science fiction perspective physicist blob quarks electrons moving around certain pattern processing information certain ways also blob quarks electrons im smarter water bottle im made different kinds quarks im made quarks quarks exact kind theres secret sauce think pattern information processing means theres law physics saying cant create technology help us incredibly intelligent help us crack mysteries couldnt words think weve really seen tip intelligence iceberg far yeah perceptronium yeah coined amazing term hypothetical state matter sort thinking physics perspective kind matter help youre saying subjective experience emerge consciousness emerge think consciousness physics perspective good question think many people underestimated ability make progress convincing hopeless somehow missing ingredient need theres new consciousness particle whatever happen think missing anything interesting thing consciousness gives us amazing subjective experience colors sounds emotions rather something higher level patterns information processing thats like think idea perceptronium mean arbitrary physical system conscious terms particles information dont think hate carbon chauvinism attitude made carbon atoms smart conscious theres something information processing kind matter performs yeah see favorite equations describing various fundamental aspects world feel think one day maybe someone whos watching come equations information processing satisfy conscious im quite convinced big discovery made lets face know many things made information know information processing conscious conscious also know lot information processing conscious like information processing happening brain right conscious like 10 megabytes per second coming even visual system youre conscious heartbeat regulation things even ask like read says look oh know said youre aware computation actually happened consciousness like ceo got email end final answer makes difference think thats great science mystery actually studying little bit lab mit also think really urgent question answer starters mean youre emergency room doctor unresponsive patient coming wouldnt great addition ct scanner consciousness scanner could figure whether person actually locked syndrome actually comatose future imagine build robots machine really good conversations think likely happen wouldnt want know home helper robot actually experiencing anything like zombie mean would prefer would prefer would prefer actually unconscious dont feel guilty switching giving boring chores would prefer well certainly would prefer would prefer appearance consciousness question whether appearance consciousness different consciousness sort ask question think need understand consciousness solve hard problem consciousness order build something like agi system dont think think probably able build things even dont answer question want make sure happens good thing better solve first wonderful controversy youre raising basically three points view hard problem two different points view conclude hard problem consciousness bs one hand people like daniel dennett say consciousness bs consciousness thing intelligence theres difference anything acts conscious conscious like also lot people including many top ai researchers know say oh consciousness bullshit course machines never conscious theyre always going zombies never feel guilty treat theres third group people including giulio tononi example krzysztof koch number others would put also middle camp say actually information processing conscious lets find equation used determine think weve little bit lazy kind running away problem long time almost taboo even mention c word lot circles stop making excuses science question ways even test theory makes predictions coming back helper robot mean said youd want helper robot certainly act conscious treat like conversations stuff think wouldnt would feel would feel little bit creeped realized glossed tape recorder know zombie faking emotion would prefer actually experience would prefer actually experiencing anything feel dont feel guilty difficult question know like youre relationship say well love person said love back like asking well really love back saying love back dont really want actually love hard hard really know difference everything seeming like theres consciousness present theres intelligence present theres affection passion love actually im sure like ask question like make bit pointed mass general hospital right across river right yes suppose youre going medical procedure theyre like know anesthesia going going give muscle relaxants wont able move youre going feel excruciating pain whole surgery wont able anything going give drug erases memory would cool whats difference youre conscious theres behavioral change right right thats really thats really clear way put thats yeah feels like sense experiencing valuable quality actually able subjective experiences least case valuable think humans little bit bad track record also making self serving arguments entities arent conscious know people often say oh animals cant feel pain okay boil lobsters ask hurt didnt say anything paper saying lobsters feel pain boil theyre banning switzerland slaves often said oh dont mind dont maybe arent conscious women dont souls whatever im little bit nervous hear people take axiom machines cant experience ever think really fascinating science question lets research try figure makes difference unconscious intelligent behavior conscious intelligent behavior terms think boston dynamics human robot sort broom pushed around starts pushing consciousness question let ask think agi system like neuroscientists believe needs physical embodiment needs body something like body dont think mean conscious experience consciousness think helps lot physical embodiment learn kind things world important us humans sure dont think physical embodiment necessary youve learned experience think youre dreaming right eyes closed youre getting sensory input youre behaving moving way theres still experience right clearly experience see something cool dreams isnt coming eyes information processing brain experience right put another way ill say comes neuroscience reason want body physical something like physical know physical system want able preserve something order self could argue would need kind embodiment self want preserve well getting little bit anthropomorphic anthropomorphizing things maybe talking self preservation instincts mean evolved organisms right darwinian evolution endowed us evolved organism self preservation instinct didnt self preservation genes think quite convincingly answer question enough one kind look hood alphazero theres one kind neuron ridiculously simple mathematical thing like physics gas waves detailed nature molecule matter collective behavior somehow similarly higher level structure network matters 20 kinds neurons think brain complicated mess wasnt evolved intelligent involved also self assembling self repairing right evolutionarily attainable think pretty hunch going understand build agi fully understand brains work like understood build flying machines long able build mechanical bird yeah thats right youve given example exactly mechanical birds airplanes airplanes pretty good job flying without really mimicking bird flight even 100 years later see ted talk german mechanical bird heard mention check amazing even right still dont fly mechanical birds turned way came simpler better purposes think might thats one lesson another lesson paper first physicist thought fascinating theres close mathematical relationship actually artificial neural networks lot things weve studied physics go nerdy names like renormalization group equation hamiltonians yada yada yada look little closely first like well theres something crazy doesnt make sense know even want build super simple neural network tell apart cat pictures dog pictures right well think little bit convince must impossible one megapixel even pixel black white theres two power 1 million possible images way atoms universe right order one assign number probability dog arbitrary function images list numbers atoms universe clearly cant store hood gpu computer yet somehow works mean well means problems could try solve neural network almost impossible solve reasonably sized one showed paper fraction kind problems fraction problems could possibly pose actually care given laws physics also infinite testimony tiny little part amazingly theyre basically part yeah almost like world created mean kind come together yeah well could say maybe world created us modest interpretation world created us modest interpretation instead evolution endowed us neural networks precisely reason particular architecture opposed one laptop well adapted solving kind problems nature kept presenting ancestors makes sense brain first place able make predictions future sucky system could never solve wouldnt world think beautiful fact yeah also realize theres earlier work deeper networks good able show additional cool fact even incredibly simple problems like suppose give thousand numbers ask multiply together write lines code boom done trivial try neural network one single hidden layer youre going need two power thousand neurons multiply thousand numbers neurons atoms universe thats fascinating allow make deep network many layers need 4000 neurons perfectly feasible thats really interesting yeah another architecture type mean mentioned schrodingers equation thoughts quantum computing role kind computational unit creating intelligence system hollywood movies mention name dont want spoil way get agi building quantum computer word quantum sounds cool thats right first think dont need quantum computers build agi suspect brain quantum computer profound sense dont even wrote paper lot many years ago calculated called decoherence time long takes quantum computerness neurons gets erased random noise environment 10 minus 21 seconds cool would quantum computer head dont think fast hand cool things could quantum computers think well able soon get bigger ones might actually help machine learning even better brain example one moonshot learning much thing search youre trying train neural network get really learned something really well loss function bunch knobs turn represented bunch numbers youre trying tweak becomes good possible thing think landscape valley dimension landscape corresponds number change youre trying find minimum well known high dimensional landscape complicated things super hard find minimum quantum mechanics amazingly good like want know whats lowest energy state water possibly incredibly hard compute nature happily figure cool make cold put ball somewhere itll roll minimum happens metaphorically energy landscape quantum mechanics even uses clever tricks todays machine learning systems dont like youre trying find minimum get stuck little local minimum quantum mechanics actually tunnel barrier get unstuck thats really interesting yeah may example well one day use quantum computers help train neural networks better thats really interesting okay component kind learning process example yeah let ask sort wrapping little bit let return questions human nature love mentioned think mentioned sort helper robot could think also personal robots think way human beings fall love get connected possible achieve ai system human level ai intelligence system think would ever see kind connection know discussion solving complex goals kind human social connection think thats one goals peaks valleys raising sea levels well able achieve think thats something thats ultimately least short term relative goals achievable think possible mean recent theres wide range guesses know among ai researchers going get agi people know like friend rodney brooks says going hundreds years least many others think going happen much sooner recent polls maybe half ai researchers think going get agi within decades happens course think things possible terms whether happen think shouldnt spend much time asking think happen future sort pathetic passive bystanders know waiting future happen us hey ones creating future right proactive ask sort future would like happen going make like well prefer sort incredibly boring zombie like future theres mechanical things happening theres passion emotion experience maybe even would course much rather prefer things find value humanity subjective experience passion inspiration love know create future things happen things exist know think ultimately universe giving meaning us us giving meaning universe build advanced intelligence lets make sure build way meaning part lot people seriously study problem think different angles trouble majority cases think happen ones beneficial humanity yeah thoughts whats people know really dont like people terrified whats way people think way solve make better dont think panicking going help way going increase chances things going well either even situation real threat help everybody freaks course course think yeah course ways things go horribly wrong first important think thing problems risks also remember huge upsides get right right everything love society civilization product intelligence amplify intelligence machine intelligence anymore lose loved one told incurable disease things like course aspire motivator think reminding reason try solve problems trying avoid gloom trying something great terms risks think really important question ask today actually help make outcome good right dismissing risk one find quite funny often im discussion panels things people work companies always like oh nothing worry nothing worry nothing worry academics sometimes express concerns thats surprising think right upton sinclair quipped right hard make man believe something income depends believing frankly know lot people companies theyre concerned anyone else youre ceo company thats something want go record saying silly journalists gonna put picture terminator robot quote issues real way think issue basically real choice first gonna dismiss risks say well lets go ahead build machines everything better cheaper lets make obsolete fast possible could possibly go wrong thats one attitude opposite attitude think say heres incredible potential lets think kind future really really excited shared goals really aspire towards lets think really hard actually get start dont start thinking risks start thinking goals think obstacles want avoid often get students coming right office career advice always ask question want future say oh maybe ill cancer maybe ill get run truck yeah focus obstacles instead goals shes going end hypochondriac paranoid whereas comes fire eyes like want talk obstacles see circumvent thats think much much healthier attitude feel challenging come vision future unequivocally excited im talking vague terms like yeah lets cure cancer fine im talking kind society want create want mean human age ai age agi conversation broad inclusive conversation gradually start converging towards future direction least want steer towards right well much motivated constructively take obstacles think try wrap succinct way think agree already aspire build agi doesnt overpower us empowers us think many various ways whether thats side world autonomous vehicles im personally actually camp believes human level intelligence required achieve something like vehicles would actually something would enjoy using part thats one example certainly theres lot types robots medicine focusing coming obstacles coming ways go wrong solving one time build autonomous vehicle even could build one would drive fine without maybe things life would actually want thats right right like example think society whole things find meaningful doesnt mean stop machines better im gonna stop playing tennis day someone builds tennis robot beat people still playing chess even go yeah near term even people advocating basic income replace jobs government gonna willing hand cash people nothing one also seriously consider whether government also hire lot teachers nurses kind jobs people often find great fulfillment right get tired hearing politicians saying oh cant afford hiring teachers gonna maybe basic income serious research thought gives meaning lives jobs give much income right mm hmm think future roles wanna people continually feeling empowered machines think sort come russia soviet union think lot people 20th century going moon going space inspiring thing feel like universe mind ai understanding creating intelligence 21st century really surprising ive heard mention really surprising research funding side funded greatly could importantly politician side part public discourse except killer bots terminator kind view people yet think perhaps excited possible positive future build together politicians usually focus next election cycle right single important thing feel humans learned entire history science masters underestimation underestimated size cosmos realizing everything thought existed small part something grander right planet solar system galaxy clusters galaxies universe know future much potential ancestors could ever dreamt cosmos imagine earth completely devoid life except cambridge massachusetts wouldnt kind lame ever aspired stay cambridge massachusetts forever go extinct one week even though earth gonna continue longer sort attitude think cosmic scale life flourish earth four years billions years even tell move harms way sun gets hot much resources today maybe lot planets bacteria cow like life opportunity seems far tell largely dead like sahara desert yet opportunity help life flourish around billions years lets quit squabbling whether little border drawn one mile left right look skies realize hey incredible things yeah thats think really exciting others connected work elon musk hes literally going space really exploring universe wonderful exactly elon musk misunderstood right misconstrued kind pessimistic doomsayer reason cares much ai safety almost anyone else appreciates amazing opportunities well squander wipe earth going wipe next generation generations incredible opportunity thats would really waste ai people think would better without technology let mention dont improve technology question isnt whether humanity going go extinct question whether going get taken next big asteroid next super volcano something else dumb could easily prevent tech right want life flourish throughout cosmos ai key mentioned lot detail book right even many inspired sci fi writers feel totally underestimated opportunities space travel especially galaxies werent thinking possibility agi makes much easier right yeah goes view agi enables progress enables better life thats beautiful way put something strive max thank much thank time today awesome thank much thanks great day got cleaned gene pool right build artificial general intelligence mind space design much much larger specific subset minds evolve agi mind doesnt necessarily self preservation instinct also doesnt necessarily individualistic us like imagine could first also afraid death know suppose could back every five minutes airplane crash youre like shucks im gonna lose last five minutes experiences since last cloud backup dang know big deal could copy experiences minds easily like could easily silicon based right maybe would feel little bit like hive mind actually maybe dont think take granted agi sort competitive alpha male instincts hand know really interesting think people go far say course dont concerns either advanced ai instincts build anything want theres nice set arguments going back steve omohundro nick bostrom others pointing build machines normally build kind goal know win chess game drive car safely whatever soon put goal machine especially kind open ended goal machine intelligent itll break bunch sub goals one goals almost always self preservation breaks dies process gonna accomplish goal right like suppose build little little robot tell go store market get food make cook italian dinner know someone mugs tries break way robot incentive get destroyed defend run away otherwise gonna fail cooking dinner afraid death really wants complete dinner cooking goal self preservation instinct continue functional agent somehow similarly give kind ambitious goal agi likely wanna acquire resources better exactly sort sub goals might intended concerns agi safety come give goal seems completely harmless realize also trying things didnt want maybe smarter us fascinating let pause kind human centric way see fear death valuable motivator dont think think thats artifact evolution thats kind mind space evolution created sort almost obsessed self preservation kind genetic flow dont think thats necessary afraid death kind sub goal self preservation keep thing fundamentally sort finite thing like ends point interesting think necessary precisely intelligence also consciousness think really like finite death fear important answer agree whether necessary intelligence consciousness clear define two words cause lot really smart people define different ways panel ai experts couldnt agree define intelligence even define intelligence simply ability accomplish complex goals like broad definition dont want carbon chauvinist right case certainly doesnt require fear death would say alpha go alpha zero quite intelligent dont think alpha zero fear turned doesnt understand concept even similarly consciousness mean could certainly imagine simple kind experience certain plants kind experience dont think theyre afraid dying theres nothing anyway much wasnt much value seriously think ask conscious maybe would might call exciting life feel passion really appreciate things maybe somehow maybe perhaps help backdrop hey finite lets make lets live fullest knew going live forever think would change yeah mean perspective would incredibly boring life living forever sort loose subjective terms said something exciting something humans would understand think yeah seems finiteness important well good news based understand cosmology everything universe probably ultimately probably finite although big crunch big whats infinite expansion yeah could big chill big crunch big rip thats big snap death bubbles billion years away certainly vastly time ancestors thought still still pretty hard squeeze infinite number compute cycles even though loopholes might possible think know people like say live youre youre going die five years thats sort optimal maybe good assumption build civilization finite safe side right exactly mentioned defining intelligence ability solve complex goals would draw line would try define human level intelligence superhuman level intelligence consciousness part definition consciousness come definition think intelligence spectrum many different kinds goals goal good chess player good goal player good car driver good investor good poet et cetera intelligence nature isnt something measure one number overall goodness people better people better right machines much better us narrow tasks like multiplying large numbers fast memorizing large databases playing chess playing go soon driving cars theres still machine match human child general intelligence artificial general intelligence agi name course course definition quest build machine everything well old holy grail ai back inception sixties ever happens course think going biggest transition history life earth doesnt necessarily wait big impact machines better us knitting really big change doesnt come exactly moment theyre better us everything really big change comes first big changes start becoming better us jobs takes away much demand human labor really whopping change comes become better us ai research right right timescale ai research limited human research development cycle years typically know long take one release software iphone whatever next google replace 40000 engineers 40000 equivalent pieces software whatever theres reason years principle much faster timescale future progress ai science technology driven machines humans simple point gives right incredibly fun controversy whether intelligence explosion called singularity werner vinge called idea articulated ij good obviously way back fifties see alan turing others thought even earlier asked exactly would define human level intelligence yeah glib answer say something better us cognitive tasks better human cognitive tasks really interesting bar think goes little bit lower actually theyre better us ai programming general learning want get better us anything studying theyre better key word better towards kind spectrum complexity goals able accomplish another way thats certainly clear definition human love theres almost like sea thats rising things geographic show really nice way put theres peaks theres ocean level elevating solve problems kind take pause took bunch questions lot social networks bunch people asked sort slightly different direction creativity things perhaps arent peak human beings flawed perhaps better means contradiction flawed way let sort start easy first lot cool equations let ask whats favorite equation first know theyre like children like one shirt equation master key quantum mechanics micro world equation protect everything atoms molecules way right yeah okay quantum mechanics certainly beautiful mysterious formulation world id like sort ask example perhaps doesnt beauty physics mathematics abstract andrew wiles proved fermats last theorem saw recently kind caught eye little bit 358 years conjectured simple formulation everybody tried prove everybody failed heres guy comes along eventually proves fails prove proves 94 said like moment everything connected place interview said indescribably beautiful moment finally realize connecting piece two conjectures said indescribably beautiful simple elegant couldnt understand id missed stared disbelief 20 minutes day walked around department keep coming back desk looking see still still couldnt contain excited important moment working life nothing ever mean much particular moment kind made think would take think small levels maybe let ask moment like life idea like wow yes wouldnt mention breath andrew wiles ive certainly number aha moments realized something cool physics completely made head explode fact favorite discoveries made later later realized discovered earlier someone sometimes got quite famous late even publish doesnt diminish way emotional experience realize like wow yeah would take moment wow moment think takes intelligence system agi system ai system moment like thats tricky question actually two parts right one accomplish proof prove never write n plus b n equals three equal z n integers et cetera et cetera n bigger two thats simply question intelligence build machines intelligent think time get machine independently come level proofs probably quite close agi second question question consciousness likely machine actually experience opposed like zombie would expect sort emotional response anything akin human emotion accomplishes machine goal views somehow something positive sublime deeply meaningful would certainly hope future create machines peers even descendants would certainly hope sublime appreciation life way absolutely worst nightmare would point future distant future maybe cosmos teeming post biological life seemingly cool stuff maybe last humans time species eventually fizzles like well thats ok proud descendants look worst nightmare havent solved consciousness problem havent realized zombies theyre aware anything tape recorder kind experience whole thing become play empty benches would ultimate zombie apocalypse would much rather case beings really appreciate amazing picture would role creativity people ask creativity think intelligence certainly story told beginning book involved creating movies making money make lot money modern world music movies intelligent system may want get good thats necessarily mean creativity important complex goals sea rising something creative human centric thinking creativity somehow special relative intelligence hunch think creativity simply aspect intelligence careful human vanity tendency often want say soon machines something try diminish say oh thats real intelligence isnt creative thing ask write definition actually mean creative mean andrew wiles example dont often mean someone takes unexpected leap like taking 573 multiplying 224 step straightforward cookbook like rules right maybe make connection two things people never thought connected something like think aspect intelligence actually one important aspects maybe reason humans tend better traditional computers something comes naturally youre neural network youre traditional logic gate based computer machine physically connections activate activate activate bing hunch ever build machine could give task hey say hey realized want travel around world instead month teach agi course like ok ill everything would done improvises stuff would mind involve lot creativity yeah actually beautiful way put think try grasp definition intelligence everything dont understand build humans try find things machines dont maybe creativity one things one words use describe thats really interesting way put dont think need defensive dont think anything good comes saying well somehow special know contrary wise many examples history trying pretend somehow superior intelligent beings led pretty bad results right nazi germany said somehow superior people today still lot cruelty animals saying superior somehow cant feel pain slavery justified kind really weak arguments dont think actually go ahead build artificial general intelligence things better us dont think try found self worth sort bogus claims superiority terms intelligence think instead find calling meaning life experiences meaningful experiences even people smarter go faculty meeting talk something certainly realize oh boy old prize old prize old prize dont one make enjoy life less enjoy talking people less course contrary feel honored privileged get interact intelligent beings better lot stuff dont think theres reason cant approach intelligent machines thats really interesting people dont often think think theres going theres machines intelligent naturally think thats going beneficial type intelligence dont realize could like peers nobel prizes would fun talk might clever certain topics fun drinks well also another example relate doesnt terrible thing presence people even smarter us around two years old mean parents much intelligent us right worked ok goals aligned goals think really number one key issue solve value align value alignment problem exactly people see many hollywood movies lousy science fiction plot lines worry wrong thing right worry machine suddenly turning evil malice concern competence definition intelligent makes competent intelligent goal playing computer playing less intelligent one define intelligence ability accomplish goal winning going intelligent one wins human agi thats intelligent ways different goals guess whos going get way right reading particular rhinoceros species driven extinct years ago ellen bummer looking cute picture mommy rhinoceros child humans drive extinction wasnt evil rhino haters whole goals werent aligned rhinoceros didnt work well rhinoceros intelligent right think important ever build agi unleash anything make sure learns understand goals adopts goals retains goals cool interesting problem us human beings trying formulate values could think united states constitution way people sat time bunch white men good example say formulated goals country lot people agree goals actually held pretty well thats interesting formulation values failed miserably ways value alignment problem solution able put paper program human values difficult think important really give best difficult two separate reasons theres technical value alignment problem figuring make machines understand goals adopt retain theres separate part philosophical part whose values anyway since like great consensus planet values mechanism create aggregate decide ok whats good compromise second discussion cant left tech nerds like refuse talk agi gets built whos going actually making decision whose values going bunch dudes tech company necessarily representative humankind want entrust even uniquely qualified speak future human happiness theyre good programming ai id much rather really inclusive conversation think possible create beautiful vision includes diversity cultural diversity various perspectives discussing rights freedoms human dignity hard come consensus think certainly really important thing try think feasible think theres better way guarantee failure refuse talk refuse try also think really bad strategy say ok lets first discussion long time reach complete consensus well try load machine shouldnt let perfect enemy good instead start kindergarten ethics pretty much everybody agrees put machines even look anyone builds passenger aircraft wants never circumstances fly building mountain yet september 11 hijackers able even embarrassingly andreas lubitz depressed germanwings pilot flew passenger jet alps killing 100 people told autopilot told freaking computer change altitude 100 meters even though gps maps everything computer like ok take basic values problem dont agree problem weve lazy try put machines make sure airplanes computers refuse something like go safe mode maybe lock cockpit door go nearest airport theres much technology world well really becoming quite timely put sort basic values like even cars weve enough vehicle terrorism attacks people driven trucks vans pedestrians crazy idea hardwired car yeah lot theres always going people reason want harm others people dont technical expertise figure work around something like car wont helps lets start theres lot thats great point chasing perfect theres lot things world agrees yeah lets start lets start start well also get habit kind conversations okay else put discussions gradual process great also means describing things describing machine one thing conversations stephen wolfram im sure youre familiar stephen oh yeah know quite well works bunch things cellular automata simple computable things computation systems kind mentioned probably already within systems already something thats agi meaning like dont know cant talk give chance try least form question think interesting idea think intelligent systems dont know describe something cant communicate us know youre little bit work explainable ai trying get ai explain thoughts natural language processing kind communication ai explain something us explain something machines think differently two separate parts question one communication super interesting ill get sec whether already agi havent noticed right beg differ dont think theres anything cellular automaton anything internet whatever artificial general intelligence really exactly everything humans better think day happens happens soon notice well probably notice even big way second part though wait ask sorry beautiful way formulating consciousness information processing think intelligence information processing think entire universe particles systems roaming around information processing power dont think something power process information way human beings thats needs sort connected seems little bit philosophical perhaps theres something compelling idea power already focus able communicate well agree certain sense hardware processing power already universe think computer already right constantly computing water waves devolved water waves river charles move air molecules around seth lloyd pointed colleague even rigorous way think entire universe quantum computer pretty clear universe supports amazing processing power even within physics computer live right even build actual laptops stuff clearly power compute power nature opinion kind wasting boring stuff like simulating yet another ocean wave somewhere one even looking right sense life build computers rechanneling compute nature anyway things interesting yet another ocean wave lets something cool raw hardware power sure even computing whats going happen next five seconds water bottle takes ridiculous amount compute human computer water bottle mean water bottle agi agi means also able like ive written book done interview dont think communication problems dont really think although buddhists say watch water beauty theres depth beauty nature communicate communication also important though mean look part job teacher know intelligent professors even bit hard time communicating come brilliant ideas communicate somebody else also able simulate mind yes empathy build well enough understand model mind say things understand thats quite difficult thats today frustrating computer makes cancer diagnosis ask well saying surgery reply trained five terabytes data diagnosis boop boop beep beep doesnt really instill lot confidence right think lot work communication kind think youre little bit work explainable ai think promising avenues mostly sort alexa problem natural language processing able actually use human interpretable methods communication able talk system talk back fundamental problems solved think natural language processing obviously important also nerdy fundamental problems like take play chess course im russian speak russian yes speak russian excellent didnt know learn russian speak bad russian im autodidact bought book teach russian read lot difficult wow thats speak bad many languages know wow thats really impressive dont know wife calculation point play chess looked alphazero games actual games check mind blowing really beautiful ask go talk demis hassabis know others deepmind theyll ultimately able give big tables numbers matrices define neural network stare tables numbers till face turn blue youre gonna understand much made move even natural language processing tell human language oh five seven points two eight still gonna really help think theres whole spectrum fun challenges involved taking computation intelligent things transforming something equally good equally intelligent thats understandable think thats really valuable think put machines charge ever infrastructure world power grid trading stock market weapon systems absolutely crucial trust ais want trust really comes understanding fundamental way thats im working think gonna hope ensuring machines adopted goals theyre gonna retain kind trust think needs based things actually understand preferably even improve theorems even self driving car right someone tells trained tons data never crashed less reassuring someone actually proof maybe computer verified proof still says circumstances car gonna swerve oncoming traffic kind information helps build trust helps build alignment goals least awareness goals values aligned think even short term look know today right absolutely pathetic state cybersecurity three billion yahoo accounts cant pack almost every americans credit card happening ultimately happening software nobody fully understood worked thats bugs hadnt found right think ai used effectively offense hacking also used defense hopefully automating verifiability creating systems built different ways actually prove things important speaking software nobody understands works course bunch people ask paper thoughts deep cheap learning work well thats paper thoughts deep learning kind simplified models brains able successful perception work pattern recognition work alphazero clever things thoughts promise limitations piece great think number important insights important lessons always draw kinds successes one look human brain see complicated 10th 11 neurons different kinds neurons yada yada theres long debate whether fact dozens different kinds actually necessary intelligence',\n",

meditation different forms experiences experience sit maybe next skip couple generations ibm watson something jeopardy gap guess question watson might much smarter us human alive may experience gap well thats big big question thats occupied people last certainly last 50 years since know since advent birth computers thats question alan turing tried answer course indirect way proposing test operational test thats really thats know tried get mean person think test right lock away communication try guess whether person whether computer system theres question soon know alexa siri know google pass test right game know ultimately certainly generation machines speak complete poise remember everything ever said theyll remember every email ever like samantha remember movie yeah theres question going happen course key question feel like anything samantha movie feel like anything watson one strongly think two different concepts co mingle concept intelligence natural artificial concept consciousness experience natural artificial different things historically associate consciousness intelligence live world leaving aside computers natural selection surrounded creatures either kin less intelligent go across species adapted particular environment others less adapted whether whale dog go talk paramecium little worm see complexity nervous system goes one cell specialized cells worm three nets 30 percent cells nerve cells creature like us like blue whale 100 billion even nerve cells based behavioral evidence based underlying neuroscience believe creatures become complex better adapted particular ecological niche become conscious partly brain grows believe consciousness unlike ancient ancient people thought almost every culture thought consciousness intelligence heart still see today see honey love heart actually say honey love lateral hypothalamus valentines day give sweetheart know hypothalamus piece chocolate heart shaped chocolate anyway still language believe brain see brains different complexity think well different levels consciousness theyre capable different experiences confront world know beginning engineer intelligence radical unclear whether intelligence engineering anything consciousness whether experience anything fundamentally whats difference intelligence function intelligence matter exactly define sort adaptation new environments able learn quickly understand know setup whats going actors whats going happen next thats function consciousness function consciousness sense much fundamental see several cases see instance case clinic youre dealing patients lets say stroke traffic accident et cetera theyre pretty much immobile terri schiavo may heard historically person 90s florida heart stood still reanimated next 14 years whats called vegetative state thousands people vegetative state theyre know theyre know theyre like occasionally open eyes two three four five six eight hours close eyes sleep wake cycle occasionally behaviors like know theres way establish lawful relationship say doctor says mom says patient isnt behavior yet people still experience design build brain machine interfaces see theres still experience something course cases locked state theres famous book called diving bell butterfly editor french editor stroke brainstem unable move except vertical eyes eye movement could move eyes dictated entire book people even lose end evidence seems suggest theyre still case behavior consciousness second case tonight like us youre going go sleep close eyes go sleep wake inside sleeping body conscious experiences different everyday experience might fly might surprised youre flying might meet long dead pet childhood dog youre surprised youre meeting conscious experience love hate emotional body state typically rem state sends active signal motor neurons paralyze called atonia dont like patients act dreams get example rem behavioral disorder bad juju get okay third case pure experience recently people call mystical experience went singapore went flotation tank yeah right big tub filled water thats body temperature epsom salt strip completely naked lie inside close lid darkness complete darkness soundproof quickly become bodiless youre floating youre naked rings watch nothing dont feel body anymore theres sound soundless theres photon sightless timeless early actually hear heart sort adapt sort passage time ceases yeah train like meditation think early think lot little bit spooky feel somewhat uncomfortable think well im going get bored try think actively become mindless bodiless timeless know soundless sightless mindless youre conscious experience youre asleep yeah youre asleep pure youre pure isnt function arent computation youre remembering youre projecting youre planning yet fully conscious youre fully conscious theres something going could side effect mean epiphenomena whats select meaning function able lay sensory free deprivation tank still conscious experience evolutionary evolutionary obviously didnt evolve flotation tanks environment mean biology notoriously bad asking question telenormical question two eyes dont four eyes like teachers three eyes something well theres probably function good answering questions speculate endlessly biology science good mechanistic question charge universe right find certain universe positive negative charges quantum mechanics hold know doesnt theory hold quantum mechanics holding universe unclear telenormical question questions difficult answer theres relationship complexity brain processing power consciousness however cases three examples gave one everyday experience night one trauma third one principle everybody sort mystical experiences dissociation function intelligence consciousness caught asking question let ask question thats question youre giving talk later today turing test intelligence consciousness drawing lines two scientific way say theres consciousness present entity anticipate answer cause also theres neurobiological answer test human brain take machine brain dont know tests yet would even begin approach test theres consciousness present thing okay thats really good question let take two steps point humans lets stick humans theres test called zap zip procedure ping brain using transcranial magnetic stimulation look electrical reverberations essentially using eg measure complexity brain response awake people asleep normal people awake people anesthetize patients hundred percent accuracy cases youre clear patient person either conscious unconscious complexity either high low adopt techniques similar creatures like monkeys dogs mice similar brains course point may help dont cortex know send magnetic pulse iphone computer probably going break something dont need ultimately need theory consciousness cant rely intuition intuition well yeah somebody talks theyre conscious however patients children babies dont talk right believe babies also conscious experiences right patients mentioned dont talk dream cant talk youre paralyzed ultimately need cant rely intuition need theory conscience tells us piece matter piece highly excitable matter like brain like computer gives rise conscious experience believe none us believes anymore old story soul right used common explanation people accept instill lot people today believe well theres theres god endowed us special thing animals dont rene descartes famously said dog hit carriage may yell may cry doesnt special thing doesnt magic magic soul doesnt res cogitans soul believe isnt case anymore difference brains guys silicon particular behavior matches siri alexa 20 years talk good possible human grounds say shes conscious particular says course well course im conscious ask shell say well know theyll generate way course shell behave like like person theres several differences one relates problem hard consciousness hard problem subjective right know direct experience consciousness dont experience consciousness assume sort bayesian person believes probability theory know abduction best available facts deduce brain similar mine put scanner brain roughly going behave way know give muesli ask taste tell things know would also say less right infer based youre conscious theory cant really need theory tells system makes conscious theory yes integrated information theory let first maybe introduction people familiar descartes talk lot pan panpsychism describe uh physicalism versus dualism mentioned soul history idea idea panpsychism debate really uh panpsychism um emerge um dualism versus uh physicalism see panpsychism fitting argue theres okay lets step back panpsychism ancient belief thats around uh mean plato aristotle talks uh modern philosophers talk course buddhism idea prevalent mean different versions one version says everything ensouled everything rocks stones dogs people forest iphones us right matter ensouled thats sort one version another version biology creatures small large single cell giant sequoia tree feel like something one think somewhat realistic um different versions mean feel like something feelings kind feels like something may well possible feels like something paramecium think pretty likely feels like something bee mouse dog sure okay see thats also panpsychism broad people example bertrand russell tried advocate idea called rasselian monism panpsychism really physics viewed inside idea physics good describing relationship among objects like charges like gravity right know describe relationship curvature mass distribution okay thats relationship among things physics doesnt really describe ultimate reality relationship among know quarks stuff like third person observer yes yes yes consciousness physics feels inside conscious experience way physics brain particularly cortex feels inside paramecium got remember say paramecium well thats pretty dumb creature already billion different molecules probably know 5000 different proteins assembled highly highly complex system single person computer system far planet ever managed accurately simulate complexity vastly escapes us yes may well little thing feels like tiny bit doesnt voice head like doesnt expectations know doesnt complex things may well feel like something yeah really interesting draw lines maybe try understand difference life intelligence consciousness see define living thing conscious thing intelligent thing intermix totally separate okay thats question dont full answer lot stuff talking today full mysteries fascinating ones right example go aristotle whos probably important scientist philosopher whos ever lived certainly western culture idea called hylomorphism quite popular days different forms soul soul really form something says biological creatures vegetative soul thats life principle today think understand something biochemistry nonlinear thermodynamics said sensitive soul animals humans also sensitive soul petitive soul see smell drives want reproduce want eat et cetera humans called rational soul okay idea made christendom rational soul one lives forever unclear wasnt really mean different readings aristotle give different whether believe rational soul immortal probably think didnt course made plato christianity soul became immortal became connection god ask essentially modern conception three aristotle would called different forms life think know something least life planet right although dont understand originate difficult rigorously pin see modern definitions death fact right theres conference ongoing tries define legally medically death used simple death stop breathing heart stops beating youre dead totally uncontroversial youre unsure wait another 10 minutes patient doesnt breathe hes dead well ventilators heart pacemakers much difficult define death typically death defined end life life defined death okay dont really good definitions intelligence dont rigorous definition know something measure called iq g factors right beginning build narrow sense right like go alphago watson know google cars uber cars still narrow ai people thinking artificial general intelligence roughly said something ability learn adapt new environments said also radical difference experience unclear build machine agi priori clear machine consciousness may may lets ask way think try build artificial general intelligence system think figuring build artificial consciousness would help get agi put another way think intelligent requires consciousness human goes hand hand human think biology consciousness intelligence goes hand hand quay illusion brain evolved highly complex complexity via theory integrated information theory sort ultimately closely tied consciousness ultimately causal power upon evolved systems go together artificial system particularly digital machines go together ask point blank alexa 200 year 2040 easily pass every turing test conscious even claims shes conscious fact could even radical version thought experiment build computer simulation human brain know henry markham blue brain project human brain project switzerland trying lets grant success 10 years perfect simulation human brain every neuron simulated larynx motor neurons brocas area course theyll talk theyll say hi woke feel great ok even computer simulation principle map onto brain conscious simulates difference simulated real simulates behavior associated consciousness might done properly intelligence particular person theyre simulating simulating intelligence conscious experiences give really nice metaphor engineers physicists typically get write einsteins field equation nine ten equations describe link general relativity curvature mass run laptop predict central black hole center galaxy massive twist space time around light escape black hole funny ever wondered doesnt computer simulation suck simulates gravity doesnt causal power gravity thats huge difference difference real simulator like doesnt get wet inside computer computer runs code simulates weather storm order artificial consciousness give causal power human brain build called neuromorphic machine hardware similar human brain digital clocked phenomenon computer thats clarify though think consciousness required create human level intelligence seems accompany human brain machine thats correct maybe agi lets dig little bit mean intelligence one thing g factor kind iq tests intelligence think maybe another way say 2040 2050 people siri really impressive think people say siri intelligent yes intelligence amorphous thing intelligent seems like kind connections human beings sense impress intelligence feels somehow operate world full humans feels like something like consciousness think worlds best natural nlp system natural language understanding generation get us happy say know weve created agi dont know happy yes believe get call high level functional intelligence particular sort g know fluid like intelligence cherish particularly place like mit right machines see priori reasons see lot reason believe going happen know next 50 years 30 years beneficial ai creating ai system thats mentioned ethics exceptionally intelligent also know aligns values values humanity think needs consciousness yes think good argument concerned ai threat ai la nick bostrom existentialist threat think intelligence empathy right find abusing dog us find abhorrent abusing animal right find abhorrent thing called empathy look greek really means feeling feel path empathy feeling see somebody else suffer isnt even conspecific person wife kids dog feel naturally us us us feel emphatic may well long term interest survival homo sapiens sapiens build agi really becomes powerful emphatic response doesnt exterminate humanity part full conscious experience create consciousness artificial human consciousness think fear maybe going get earlier days nietzsche think fear suffering essential consciousness full range experience system experience system particular kinds positive experiences look principle people done rat implant electrode hypothalamus pleasure center rat rat stimulates beyond anything else doesnt care food natural sex drink anymore stimulates pleasurable feeling guess like orgasm day long priori see reason need great variety clearly survive wouldnt work right id engineered artificially dont think need great variety conscious experience could pleasure fear might terrible existence think thats possible least conceptual logical ground real creature whether artificially engineered want give fear fear extinction also want give positive repetitive states states want machine encouraged give machine positive feedback mentioned panpsychism jump back little bit everything kind mental property go something like human consciousness everything elements consciousness something special human consciousness everything like spoon form panpsychism think doesnt ascribe consciousness anything like spoon liver however theory integrated information theory say system even one looks outside relatively simple least internal causal power feel like something theory priori doesnt say anything whats special human biologically know one thing thats special human speak overblown sense importance believe exceptional gods gift universe behaviorally main thing plan long term language gives us enormous amount power thats current dominant species planet mentioned god grew devout roman catholic family consciousness youre sort exploring really deeply fundamental human things religion also touches religion fit thinking consciousness youve grown throughout life changed views religion far understand yeah mean im much closer im roman catholic anymore dont believe theres sort god god educated believe sits somewhere fullness time ill united sort everlasting bliss dont see evidence look world night large full wonders many things dont understand think many things cult look dont even understand 4 universe dark matter dark energy idea maybe lost socks know tell sort current religious spiritual sentiment much closer form buddhism without reincarnation unfortunately theres evidence reincarnation describe way buddhism sees world little bit well talk spent several meetings dalai lama always impressed really unlike example lets say pope cardinal always emphasized minimizing suffering creatures early beginning look suffering creatures people everybody universal course degrees animal general less capable suffering well developed normally developed human think consciousness pervades universe techniques think like mindfulness etc meditation tries access claim fundamental aspect reality im sure fundamental think theres physical theres inside view consciousness two aspects thats thing access life youve got remember conscious experience conscious experience comes prior anything know physics comes prior knowledge universe atoms super strings molecules thing directly acquainted world thats populated things images sounds head touches actually question sounds like kind rich life talk rock climbing seems like really love literature consciousness experiencing things think helped research topic yes particularly think various states example rock climbing rowing crew rowing bike every day get thing called zone ive always wanted particularly respect consciousness strangely addictive state people want keep going back wonder addicting think experience almost close pure experience zone youre conscious inner voice anymore theres always inner voice nagging pay taxes fight ex things theyre always youre zone gone youre wonderful state youre fully world youre climbing youre rowing biking soccer whatever youre sort consciousness youre action case pure experience youre action cases experience aspect conscious touch basic part conscious existence basic deeply satisfying think touch root thats really youre touching youre getting close root thats different intelligence think simulation hypothesis simulation theory idea live computer simulation rapture nerds rapture nerds think likely hypothesis engaged hundreds scholars many centuries existing mind god modern version equally plausible people love talking sort things know theyre book written simulation hypothesis thats people want thats fine seems rather esoteric never testable useful think terms maybe connecting questions free youve talked vaguely remember saying idea theres free makes uncomfortable think free physics perspective conscious perspective fit okay physics perspective leaving aside quantum mechanics believe live fully deterministic world right comes course quantum mechanics know certain things principle predictable said prefer idea initial condition universe everything else acting initial condition universe doesnt… romantic notion certainly comes consciousness think certain freedom much constrained physics course past conscious desires parents told us environment tells us know right theres hundreds experiments show influenced finally final analysis make life – im talking really critical decision really think marry go school school take job job cheat taxes things really deliberate think conditions free bring entire entire conscious question try analyze various conditions make decision free ever think free thats totally free anything wants thats possible right jack mentioned actually write blog books youve read amazing books im russian bulgakov neil gaiman carl sagan murakami book early life transformed way saw world something changed life nietzsche guess thats brooks r truster talks problems one first discoverer unconscious little bit freud air makes claims people sort guise mass charity actually noncharitable sort really first discoverer great land unconscious really struck think unconscious think freud think ideas like dark matter universe whats unconscious lot mean much think lot last 100 years research shown think genius misguided towards end started neuroscientist contributed studies lamprey contributed neuron hypothesis idea discrete units call nerve cells wrote unconscious think true theres lots stuff happening feel particular youre relationship breaks asunder right terrible love hate lust anger mixed try analyze upset difficult penetrate basements caverns mind prying eyes conscious doesnt access theyre amygdala lots places make upset angry sad depressed difficult try actually uncover reason go shrink talk friend endlessly construct finally story happened love dont love whatever dont really know whether actually happened simply dont access parts brain theyre powerful think thats feature bug brain fact deep difficult dive subconscious think feature otherwise look like brain nervous system computer severely band limited everything every emotion feel every eye movements make control consciousness wouldnt early brain conscious learn things like typing like riding bike train routes think involve basal ganglia striatum train different parts brain automatically like typing show much faster without even thinking youve got highly specialized frans krik call zombie agents theyre taking care consciousness sort worry abstract sense text want write think thats true many many things things like fights ex girlfriend things would think useful still linger somewhere subconscious seems like bug would stick think would better analyze get system better get system forget ever happened seems buggy kind well yeah general dont thats probably functional dont ability unless extreme cases clinical dissociations right people heavily abused completely repress memory doesnt happen normal people dont ability remove traumatic memories course suffer hand probably ability constantly wipe memory youd probably extent isnt useful yeah good question balance books jack mentioned correct im wrong broadly speaking academia different scientific disciplines certainly engineering reading literature seems rare pursuit im wrong thats experience people read much technical text sort escape seek truth literature seems like think value think literature adds pursuit scientific truth think good useful everybody gives access much wider array human experiences valuable think well want understand human nature nature general think better understand wide variety experiences sitting lab staring screen face flashed onto hundred milliseconds pushing button thats used thats psychologists theres nothing wrong need consider lots strange states literature shortcut well yeah literature thats literature sorts interesting experiences people contingency fact women experience world different black people experience world different one way experience reading different literature try find see everything relative read book 300 years ago thought certain problems differently us today today like culture think know thats common every culture every culture believes heyday know realize well theres ways viewing universe may lots things favor question wanted ask time scale scale general iit general try think consciousness try think ideas kind naturally think human time scales also entities sized close humans think things much larger much smaller containing consciousness think things take know eons operate conscious cause effect thats good question think lot small creatures experimentally know lot people work flies bees right people think automata theyre bugs heavens sake right look behavior like bees recognize individual humans complicated way communicate youve ever involved know parents bought house sort agonizing decision bees year right swarm spring elaborate way free scouts go individual sites come back power dance literally dance several days try recruit deets complicated decision rate finally make decision entire swarm scouts warm entire swarm go one location dont go 50 locations go one location scouts agreed upon thats awesome look circuit complexity 10 times denser anything brain million neurons neurons amazingly complex complex behavior complicated circuitry theres question experience something life different theyre tiny live know well workers live maybe two months think iit tells principle substrate consciousness substrate maximizes cause effect power possible spatial temporal grains think example know science fiction story black cloud okay classic fred hoyle astronomer cloud intervening earth sun leading sort global cooling written 50s turns using radio dish communicate actually entity actually intelligent entity sort convince move away radical different entity principle iit says well measure integrated information principle least yes maximum occurs time scale months rather assets fraction second yes would experience life moment month rather microsecond right rather fraction second human case may forms consciousness simply dont recognize radical different anything used thats good read watch science fiction movies well think know stanislav lem polish science fiction writer wrote solaris turned hollywood movie yes best novel 60s engineer hes engineer background interesting novel called victorious human civilization mission planet everything destroyed discover machines humans got killed machines took machine evolution darwinian evolution talks vividly finally dominant machine intelligence organism survived gigantic clouds little hexagonal universal cellular automata written 60s typically theyre lying ground individual times crisis communicate assemble gigantic nets clouds trillions particles become hyper intelligent beat anything humans throw beautiful compelling intelligence finally humans leave planet theyre simply unable understand comprehend creature say well either nuke entire planet destroy leave fundamentally alien alien us ideas cannot communicate yeah actually conversation youre talking us steven wolf brought could ideas already artificial general intelligence like super smart maybe conscious beings cellular automata dont know talk language communication dont know thats one sort view consciousness something measure conscious cant measure youre making ontological epistemic statement one like seeing multiverses might true cant communicate cant knowledge thats epistemic argument right two different things may well possible look another case thats happening right people building mini organoids know take stem cells arm put dish add four transcription factors induce grow large well large theyre millimeters theyre like half million neurons look like nerve cells dish called mini organoids harvard stanford everywhere theyre building may well possible theyre beginning feel like something cant really communicate right people beginning think ethics yes may perfectly right one question conscious totally separate question would know two different things could give advice young researcher sort dreaming understanding creating human level intelligence consciousness would say follow dreams read widely mean suppose discipline pursuit take neuroscience computational cognitive science philosophy computer science robotics sense okay known system high level intelligence homo sapiens wanted build probably good continue study closely humans cognitive neuroscience know somewhere cognitive neuroscience one hand philosophy mind ai ai computer science look original ideas network came neuroscience right reinforce whether snarky minsky building snarky whether know early hubel wiesel experiments harvard gave rise networks multi layer networks may well possible fact people argue make next big step ai realize limits deep convolutional networks certain things cant really understand dont cant really cant really show one image show single image somebody pickpocket steals wallet purse immediately know thats pickpocket computer system would say well man woman purse right unless train machine showing hundred thousand pickpockets right doesnt easy understanding right people make argument order go next step really want build machines understand way go psychology need understand brains enable us therefore cusp also exciting try understand better nature build take inside build think exciting thing somewhere interface cognitive science neuroscience ai computer science philosophy mind beautiful yeah id say machine learning computer science computer vision perspective many researchers kind ignore way human brain works even psychology literature studying brain would hope josh tenenbaum talks bringing thats yeah youve worked amazing stuff throughout life whats thing youre really excited whats mystery would love uncover near term beyond beyond mysteries youre already surrounded well theres structure called claustrum structure underneath cortex yay big one left right underneath underneath insula thin like one millimeter embedded wiring white matter difficult image connection every cortical region francis crick last paper ever wrote dictated corrections day died hospital paper know hypothesize well unique anatomy gets input every cortical area projects back every every cortical area function structure similar metaphor role conductor symphony orchestra different cortical players motion theory mind infer social interaction color hearing different modules cortex course consciousness consciousness puts together one package right binding problem really function relatively neurons compared cortex talks receives input projects back testing right weve got beautiful neuronal reconstruction mouse called crown thorns crown thorns neurons claustrum widespread connection neuron ive ever seen theyre individual neurons sit claustrum tiny single neuron huge axonal tree cover ipsy contralateral cortex trying turn using know fancy tools like optogenetics trying turn neurons study happens mouse thing perhaps parts become whole

interconnected network separate consciousness consciousness even matter complexity really weird one yeah could sensibly ask question whether shrimp conscious example theyre terribly complex maybe feel pain lets put part aside think sheer size neural network enough give structure knowledge suitably engineered neural networks natural selection kind equivalent engineering brains dont think theres anything mysterious sense system made silicon could ever human brain think possible principle whether itll ever happen depends clever engineering systems whether even want whether thats even sensible goal ask question locomotion system good human well kind want better human ultimately terms legged locomotion theres reason humans benchmark theyre tools might better ways may cant duplicate natural system point much cheaper use natural system going invest brainpower resources example dont really exact substitute wood still build houses wood still build furniture wood like look like feel certain properties synthetics dont theres anything magical mysterious wood extra steps duplicating everything wood something havent bothered wood likewise say cotton im wearing cotton clothing feels much better polyester cotton something magic couldnt ever synthesize something exactly like cotton point worth weve got cotton likewise case human intelligence goal making artificial system exactly like human brain goal probably know going pursue bitter end suspect want tools things better humans youre going care whether something like humans example diagnosing cancer predicting weather set humans benchmark general suspect also believe even human benchmark dont want imitate humans system theres lot learned create artificial intelligence system studying human yeah think thats right way build flying machines want understand laws aerodynamics including birds mimic birds theyre laws view ai artificial intelligence safety perspective refreshingly rational perhaps importantly elements positivity think inspiring empowering opposed paralyzing many people including ai researchers eventual existential threat ai obvious possible obvious many others including ai researchers threat obvious elon musk famously highly concerned ai camp saying things like ai far dangerous nuclear weapons ai likely destroy human civilization human civilization february said elon really serious ai threat ai would stop building self driving cars hes successfully part tesla said wow even pinker doesnt understand difference narrow ai like car general ai latter literally million times compute power open ended utility function humanity deep trouble first mean statement elon musk stop building self driving cars hes deeply concerned last time elon musk fired intemperate tweet well live world twitter power yes yeah think two kinds existential threat discussed connection artificial intelligence think theyre incoherent one vague fear ai takeover subjugated animals less technologically advanced peoples build something thats advanced us inevitably turn us pets slaves domesticated animal equivalents think confuses intelligence power happens intelligence system familiar namely homo sapiens products natural selection competitive process bundled together problem solving capacity number nasty traits like dominance exploitation maximization power glory resources influence theres reason think sheer problem solving capability set one goals goals whatever set goals long someone isnt building megalomaniacal artificial intelligence theres reason think would naturally evolve direction might say well gave goal maximizing power source thats pretty stupid goal give autonomous system dont give goal mean thats self evidently idiotic look history world theres lot opportunities engineers could instill system destructive power choose thats natural process engineering well except weapons mean youre building weapon goal destroy people think good reasons build certain kinds weapons think building nuclear weapons massive mistake maybe pause one serious threats think mistake sense stopped early think unfortunate event invention invented think possible stop guess question hard rewind clock course invented context world war ii fear nazis might develop one first initiated reason hard turn especially since winning war japanese nazis overwhelming goal every responsible person theres nothing people wouldnt done ensure victory quite possible world war ii hadnt happened nuclear weapons wouldnt invented cant know dont think means necessity weapon systems envisioned never implemented like planes would disperse poison gas cities like crop dusters systems try create earthquakes tsunamis enemy countries weaponize weather weaponize solar flares kinds crazy schemes thought better think analogies nuclear weapons artificial intelligence fundamentally misguided whole point nuclear weapons destroy things point artificial intelligence destroy things analogy misleading theres two artificial intelligence mentioned first one guess highly intelligent power hungry yeah system design give goals goals external means attain goals dont design artificially intelligent system maximize dominance wont maximize dominance familiar homo sapiens two traits come bundled together particularly men apt confuse high intelligence power thats error fear collateral damage give artificial intelligence goal like make paper clips pursue goal brilliantly stop turns us paper clips well give goal curing cancer turn us guinea pigs lethal experiments give goal world peace conception world peace people therefore fighting kill us think utterly fanciful fact think theyre actually self defeating first assume going brilliant design artificial intelligence cure cancer stupid dont specify mean curing cancer enough detail wont kill us process assumes system smart cure cancer idiotic cant figure mean curing cancer killing everyone think collateral damage scenario value alignment problem also based misconception one challenges course dont know build either system currently even close knowing course things change overnight time theorizing challenging either direction thats probably core problem without ability reason real engineering things hand imagination runs away things exactly let sort ask think motivation thought process elon musk build autonomous vehicles study autonomous vehicles study tesla autopilot think one greatest currently large scale application artificial intelligence world potentially positive impact society person whos creating good quote unquote narrow ai system also seem concerned general ai think motivation think thing well probably ask notoriously flamboyant impulsive seen detriment goals health company dont know whats going mind probably ask dont think dont think distinction special purpose ai called general ai relevant way special purpose ai going anything conceivable order attain goal engineering systems designed trade across multiple goals build cars first place didnt forget install brakes goal car go fast occurred people yes want go fast always would build brakes likewise car going autonomous program take shortest route airport going take diagonal mow people trees fences thats shortest route thats mean shortest route program thats intelligence system definition takes account multiple constraints true fact even true called general intelligence genuinely intelligent going pursue goal singlemindedly omitting every consideration collateral effect thats artificial general intelligence thats artificial stupidity agree way promise autonomous vehicles improving human welfare think spectacular im surprised little press coverage notes united states alone something like 40000 people die every year highways vastly killed terrorists spent trillion dollars war combat deaths terrorism half dozen year whereas year year 40000 people massacred highways could brought close zero im humanitarian benefit let mention person whos building cars little bit offensive say engineers would clueless enough engineer safety systems often stay night thinking 40000 people dying everything tried engineer save peoples lives every new invention im super excited deep learning literature cvpr conferences nips everything im super excited grounded making safe help people dont see trajectory sudden slip situation intelligence highly negative certainly agree think thats beginning potential humanitarian benefits artificial intelligence theres enormous attention going people whose jobs made obsolete artificial intelligence little attention given fact jobs going made obsolete horrible jobs fact people arent going picking crops making beds driving trucks mining coal soul deadening jobs whole literature sympathizing people stuck menial mind deadening dangerous jobs eliminate fantastic boon humanity granted solve one problem theres another one namely get people decent income smart enough invent machines make beds put away dishes handle hospital patients think smart enough figure redistribute income apportion vast economic savings human beings longer needed make beds okay sam harris says obvious eventually ai existential risk hes one people says obvious dont know claim goes eventually obvious dont know worry interesting argument eyes think timescale think existential threats dont really know little threat unlike nuclear weapons perhaps particular threat could happen tomorrow right likely wont likely itd hundred years away ignore talk worry think threat imagine within limits imagination within limits understanding accurately predict afraid sorry ai existential threat ai like enslaving us turning us paperclips think compelling sam harris perspective would paperclip situation yeah mean think totally fanciful mean dont build system dont give dont first code engineering dont implement system massive control testing perhaps culture engineering radically change would worry dont see signs engineers suddenly idiotic things like put electric power plant control system havent tested first scenarios imagine almost magically powered intelligence including things like cure cancer probably incoherent goal theres many different kinds cancer bring world peace mean even specify goal scenarios also imagine degree control every molecule universe unlikely would start connect systems infrastructure without testing would kind engineering system maybe engineers irresponsible need legal regulatory legal responsibility implemented engineers dont things stupid standards ive never seen enough plausible scenario existential threat devote large amounts brain power forestall believe sort power mass engineering reason argue latest book reason science sort thing guides development new technology safe also keeps us safe know granted culture safety currently part engineering mindset airplanes example yeah dont think thrown window untested powerful systems suddenly implemented theres reason think fact look progress artificial intelligence know impressive especially last 10 years idea suddenly therell step function sudden know powerful therell kind recursive self improvement kind fume also fanciful certainly technology impresses us deep learning train something hundreds thousands millions examples theyre hundreds thousands problems curing cancer typical example kind techniques allowed ai increase last five years kind going lead fantasy exponential sudden self improvement think kind magical thinking based understanding ai actually works give chance said fanciful magical thinking ted talk sam harris says thinking ai killing human civilization somehow fun intellectually say scientist engineer dont find fun im beer non ai friends indeed something fun appealing like talking episode black mirror considering large meteor headed towards earth told large meteor headed towards earth something like relate sense fun understand psychology yes good question personally dont find fun find kind actually waste time genuine threats ought thinking like pandemics like cyber security vulnerabilities like possibility nuclear war certainly climate change know enough fill many conversations think sam put finger something namely community sometimes called rationality community delights using brainpower come scenarios would occur mere mortals less cerebral people kind intellectual thrill finding new things worry one worried yet actually think though kind fun doesnt give particular pleasure think pernicious side namely overcome people dread fatalism many ways die annihilate civilization may well enjoy life theres nothing climate change doesnt us runaway robots lets enjoy weve got prioritize look threats close certainty climate change distinguish ones merely imaginable infinitesimal probabilities take account peoples worry budget cant worry everything sow dread fear terror fatalism lead kind numbness well problems overwhelming engineers going kill us lets either destroy entire infrastructure science technology lets enjoy life theres certain line worry im worried lot things engineering theres certain line worry cross youre allowed cross becomes paralyzing fear opposed productive fear thats kind youre highlighting exactly right weve seen know human effort well calibrated risk basic tenet cognitive psychology perception risk hence perception fear driven imaginability data misallocate vast amounts resources avoiding terrorism kills average six americans year one exception 9 11 invade countries invent entire new departments government massive massive expenditure resources lives defend trivial risk whereas guaranteed risks one mentioned traffic fatalities even risks plausible enough worry like pandemics like nuclear war receive far little attention presidential debates theres discussion minimize risk nuclear war lots discussion terrorism example think essential calibrate budget fear worry concern planning actual probability harm yep let ask question speaking imaginability said important think reason one favorite people likes dip outskirts reason fascinating exploration imagination joe rogan oh yes reason used believe lot conspiracies reason stripped away lot beliefs way fascinating actually watch rationality kind throw away ideas bigfoot 9 11 im sure exactly kim trails dont know believes yes okay longer believed thats right hes become real force good yep joe rogan podcast february fascinating conversation far remember didnt talk much artificial intelligence podcast couple weeks joe much concerned existential threat ai im sure youre hoping would get topic way represents quite lot people look topic ai 10000 foot level exercise communication said important rational reason things let ask coach ai researcher speak joe general public ai would advise well short answer would read sections wrote enlightenment ai longer reason would think emphasize think youre well positioned engineer remind people culture engineering really safety oriented another discussion enlightenment plot rates accidental death various causes plane crashes car crashes occupational accidents even death lightning strikes plummet culture engineering squeeze lethal risks death fire death drowning death asphyxiation drastically declined advances engineering got say appreciate saw graphs exactly people like stay night thinking oh god im inventing likely hurt people deploy ingenuity prevent happening im engineer although spent 22 years mit know something culture engineering understanding way think youre engineer essential culture suddenly switched comes artificial intelligence mean could problem reason think would switched dont think one theres enough engineers speaking way excitement positive

       " 'difference biological neural networks artificial neural networks mysterious captivating profound first theres much dont know biological neural networks thats mysterious captivating maybe holds key improving artificial neural networks one things studied recently something dont know biological neural networks would really useful artificial ones ability credit assignment long time spans things principle artificial neural nets convenient biologically plausible mismatch think kind mismatch may interesting thing study understand better brains might things dont good corresponding theories artificial neural nets b maybe provide new ideas could explore things brain differently could incorporate artificial neural nets lets break credit assignment little bit yes beautifully technical term could incorporate many things rnn memory side thinking like something knowledge building common sense knowledge time reinforcement learning sense youre picking rewards time particular achieve certain kind goal thinking first two meanings whereby store kinds memories episodic memories brain access later order help us infer causes things observing assign credit decisions interpretations came ago memories stored change way would reacted interpreted things past thats credit assignment used learning way think artificial neural networks current lstm current architectures able capture presumably youre thinking long term yes current current nets fairly good jobs sequences dozens say hundreds time steps gets harder harder depending remember consider longer durations whereas humans seem able credit assignment essentially arbitrary times like could remember something last year see new evidence im going change mind way thinking last year hopefully mistake think big part probably forgetting youre remembering really important things efficient forgetting yes theres selection remember think really cool connection higher level cognition regarding consciousness deciding emotions deciding comes consciousness gets stored memory trivial either youve forefront along showing amazing things neural networks deep neural networks field artificial intelligence broadly kinds applications talk forever view thinking towards future weakest aspect way deep neural networks represent world view missing current state art neural nets trained large quantities images texts level understanding know explains data sets basic low level nearly robust abstract general understanding okay doesnt tell us fix things think encourages us think maybe train neural nets differently would focus example causal explanation something dont currently neural net training also one thing ill talk talk afternoon fact instead learning separately images videos one hand texts hand need better job jointly learning language world refers know sides help need good world models neural nets really understand sentences talk whats going world think need language input help provide clues high level concepts like semantic concepts represented top levels neural nets fact evidence purely unsupervised learning representations doesnt give rise high level representations powerful ones getting supervised learning clues getting labels even sentences already high level think thats important thing keep mind already powerful think thats architecture challenge data set challenge neither im tempted end elaborate slightly course data sets architectures something want always play think crucial thing training objectives training frameworks example going passive observation data active agents learn intervening world relationships causes effects sort objective functions could important allow highest level explanations rise learning dont think kinds objective functions could used reward exploration right kind exploration kinds questions neither data set architecture learn objectives yeah ive heard mention several contexts idea sort way children learn interact objects world seems fascinating sense except cases reinforcement learning idea part learning process artificial neural networks almost like envision something like objective function saying know poke object kind way would really helpful learn right right sort almost guiding aspect learning right right right talking rebecca sacks minutes ago talking lots lots evidence infants seem clearly pick interests directed way theyre passive learners focus attention aspects world interesting surprising non trivial way makes change theories world thats fascinating view future progress maybe boring question think going deeper larger think increasing size things increasing lot past years going big thing think increasing size things increasing lot past years also make significant progress representational issues mentioned theyre kind shallow sense oh shallow sense abstraction sense abstraction theyre getting dont think depth network sense instead 100 layers youre going layers dont think obvious yes clear engineers companies labs grad students continue tune architectures explore kinds tweaks make current state art slightly ever slightly better dont think thats going nearly enough think need changes way considering learning achieve goal learners actually understand deep way environment know observing acting guess trying ask question thats interesting layers basically figure way learn interacting many parameters takes store information think brain quite bigger neural networks right right oh see mean oh im agree order build neural nets kind broad knowledge world typical adult humans probably kind computing power going insufficient good news hardware companies building neural net chips going get better however good news way also bad news even state art deep learning methods fail learn models understand even simple environments like grid worlds built even fairly simple environments mean course train enough examples eventually get like instead humans might need dozens examples things need millions simple tasks think theres opportunity academics dont kind computing power say google really important exciting research advance state art training frameworks learning models agent learning even simple environments synthetic seem trivial yet current machine learning fails talked priors common sense knowledge seems like humans take lot knowledge granted whats view priors forming broad view world accumulation information teach neural networks learning systems pick knowledge knowledge artificial intelligence maybe 80s like theres time knowledge representation knowledge acquisition expert systems mean symbolic ai view interesting problem set solve kind put hold little bit seems like doesnt work doesnt work thats right thats right goals remain important yes remain important think goals addressed right first believe one reason classical expert systems approach failed lot knowledge talked common sense intuition theres lot knowledge like consciously accessible lots decisions taking cant really explain even sometimes make story knowledge also necessary machines take good decisions knowledge hard codify expert systems rule based systems classical ai formalism issues course old ai like really good ways handling uncertainty would say something subtle understand better think still isnt enough minds people theres something really powerful comes distributed representations thing really makes neural nets work well hard replicate kind power symbolic world knowledge expert systems nicely decomposed like bunch rules whereas think neural net opposite big blob parameters work intensely together represent everything network knows sufficiently factorized sufficiently factorized think one weaknesses current neural nets take lessons classical ai order bring another kind compositionality common language example rules isnt native neural nets line thinking disentangled representations yes let connect disentangled representations might dont mind many years ive thought still believe really important come learning algorithms either unsupervised supervised reinforcement whatever build representations important factors hopefully causal factors nicely separated easy pick representation thats idea disentangled representations says transform data space everything becomes easy maybe learn linear models things care still think important think missing important ingredient classical ai systems remind us lets say disentangled representations still need learn relationships variables high level semantic variables theyre going independent mean like much assumption theyre going interesting relationships allow predict things future explain happened past kind knowledge relationships classical ai system encoded rules like rule like little piece knowledge says oh two three four variables linked interesting way say something one two given couple others right addition disentangling elements representation like variables rule based system also need disentangle mechanisms relate variables like rules rules neatly separated like rule know living change rule im learning doesnt need break rules whereas current neural nets example sensitive whats called catastrophic forgetting ive learned things learn new things destroy old things learned right knowledge better factorized separated disentangled would avoid lot cant sensory domain mean sensory domain like pixel space idea project data right semantic space becomes possible represent extra knowledge beyond transformation inputs representations representations act predict future way neatly disentangled rules disentangled variables disentangled draw distinction semantic space pixel like need architectural difference well yeah theres sensory space like pixels everything entangled information like variables completely interdependent complicated ways also computation like variables also related intertwined im hypothesizing right high level representation space variables relate disentangled provide lot generalization power generalization power yes distribution test set assumed distribution training set right current machine learning weak doesnt tell us anything able tell us anything neural nets say going generalize new distribution know people may think well theres nothing say dont know new distribution truth humans able generalize new distributions yeah able yeah something new distributions even though could look different training distributions things common let give concrete example read science fiction novel science fiction novel maybe know brings planet things look different surface still laws physics read book understand whats going distribution different transport lot knowledge earth underlying cause effect relationships physical mechanisms maybe even social interactions make sense going planet like visually example things totally different taking analogy distorting lets enter science fiction world say space odyssey 2001 hal maybe probably one favorite ai movies theres another one lot people love may little bit outside ai community ex machina dont know youve seen yes yes way views movie able enjoy things like things hate could talk context question want ask theres quite large community people different backgrounds often outside ai concerned existential threat artificial intelligence youve seen community develop time youve seen perspective think best way talk ai safety think discourse within ai community outside grounded fact ex machina one main sources information general public ai think youre putting right theres big difference sort discussion ought within ai community sort discussion really matter general public think picture terminator ai loose killing people super intelligence thats going destroy us whatever try isnt really useful public discussion public discussion things believe really matter short term medium term likely negative impacts ai society whether security like know big brother scenarios face recognition killer robots impact job market concentration power discrimination kinds social issues could actually could really threaten democracy example clarify said killer robots mean autonomous weapon weapon systems yes dont mean thats right think short medium term concerns important parts public debate existential risk unlikely consideration still worth academic investigation way could say study could happen meteorite know came earth destroyed think unlikely going happen happen reasonable future sort scenario ai getting loose goes understanding least current machine learning current neural nets plausible course dont crystal ball knows ai 50 years think worth scientists study problems pressing question far im concerned continue line questions like like ex machina movie actually watched second time enjoyed hated first time enjoyed quite bit second time sort learned accept certain pieces see concept movie experience thoughts negative picture paints science totally wrong science general ai particular science happening hidden place know really smart guy one person totally unrealistic happens even team people isolated place make science moves small steps thanks collaboration community large number people interacting scientists expert field kind know going even industrial labs information flows leaks spirit different way science painted movie yeah let ask point case point kind even research happens inside google facebook inside companies still kind comes ideas come think always case ai possible bottle ideas point theres set breakthroughs go completely undiscovered general research community think thats even possible possible unlikely done foresee foreseeable future course dont crystal ball science crystal ball knows science fiction think ominous lights went discussion problem theres one thing movie could imagine kinds science fiction problem maybe similar question existential risk kind movie paints wrong picture actual science going unfortunate effects peoples understanding current science thats kind sad theres important principle research diversity words research exploration research exploration space ideas different people focus different directions good essential im totally fine people exploring directions contrary mine look orthogonal mine fine think important friends dont claim universal truth especially happen future said intuitions act accordingly according think useful society gain lose debates end society theres one voice one way thinking research money spread disagreement sign good research good science yes idea bias human sense bias think instilling machine learning something thats aligned human values terms bias intuitively human beings concept bias means fundamental respect human beings means instill machine learning systems think think short term things already happening long term things need short term techniques proposed think continue improved maybe alternatives come take data sets know bias measure pretty much data set humans observed taking decisions sort bias discrimination particular groups use machine learning techniques try build predictors classifiers going less biased example using adversarial methods make systems less sensitive variables sensitive clear well defined ways trying address problem maybe weaknesses research needed think fact sufficiently mature governments start regulating companies matters say like insurance companies use techniques techniques probably reduce bias cost example maybe predictions less accurate companies force right short term long term im really interested thinking instill moral values computers obviously something well achieve next five 10 years know theres already work detecting emotions example images sounds texts also studying different agents interacting different ways may correspond patterns say injustice could trigger anger things medium term eventually train computers model example humans react emotionally would say simplest thing unfair situations trigger anger one basic emotions share animals think quite feasible within next years build systems detect kinds things extent unfortunately understand enough world around us long time away maybe initially virtual environments imagine video game agents interact ways situations trigger emotion think could train machines detect situations predict particular emotion likely felt human playing one characters shown excitement done lot excellent work unsupervised learning theres lot success supervised learning side yes yes one things im really passionate humans robots work together context supervised learning means process annotation think problem annotation put interesting way humans teaching machines yes yes think important subject reducing annotation may useful somebody building system tomorrow longer term process teaching think something deserves lot attention machine learning community people coined term machine teaching good strategies teaching learning agent design train system going good teacher group project called bbi bbi game game scenario theres learning agent teaching agent presumably teaching agent would eventually human yet role teacher use knowledge environment acquire using whatever way brute force help learner learn quickly possible learner going try learn maybe using exploration whatever teacher choose influence interaction learner guide learner maybe teach things learner trouble add boundary knows doesnt know theres tradition kind ideas fields like tutorial systems example ai course people humanities thinking questions think time machine learning people look future well human machine interaction human loop think understanding make work better problems around interesting sufficiently addressed youve done lot work language aspect traditionally formulated turing test test natural language understanding generation eyes difficult conversation eyes hardest part conversation solve machines would say everything non linguistic knowledge implicitly need order make sense sentences things like winograd schema sentences semantically ambiguous words need understand enough world order really interpret properly sentences think interesting challenges machine learning point direction building systems understand world works causal relationships world associate knowledge express language either reading writing speak french yes mother tongue one romance languages think passing turing test underlying challenges mentioned depend language think might easier french english independent language think independent language would like build systems use principles learning mechanisms learn human agents whatever language well certainly us humans talk beautifully smoothly poetry russian originally know poetry russian maybe easier convey complex ideas english maybe im showing bias people could say french course goal ultimately human brain able utilize kind languages use tools convey meaning yeah course differences languages maybe slightly better things grand scheme things trying understand brain works language think differences minute youve lived perhaps ai winter sorts yes stay warm continue research stay warm friends friends okay important friends learned experience listen inner voice dont know trying please crowds fashion strong intuition something contradicted actual evidence go mean could contradicted people instinct based everything youve learned course adapt beliefs experiments contradict beliefs stick beliefs otherwise allowed go years allowed persist directions know took time whatever people think took time mature bring fruits history ai marked course marked technical breakthroughs also marked seminal events capture imagination community recent would say alphago beating world champion human go player one moments think next moment might okay first think called seminal events overrated said science really moves small steps happens make one small step like drop know fills bucket drastic consequences youre able something able say cost building device solving problem becomes cheaper existed new market opens right especially world commerce applications impact small scientific progress could huge science think gradual steps taken theres unsupervised learning look one trend like community example milan institute two hardest topics gans reinforcement learning even though montreal particular reinforcement learning something pretty much absent two three years ago theres really big interest students theres big interest people like would say something going see progress even though hasnt yet provided much terms actual industrial fallout like even though theres alphago theres like google making money right think long term really really important many reasons words would say reinforcement learning may generally agent learning doesnt rewards could kinds ways agent learning environment reinforcement learning youre excited think gans could provide something moment well gans generative models believe crucial ingredients building agents understand world lot successes reinforcement learning past policy gradient learn policy dont actually learn model world lots issues dont know model based rl right think go order build models generalize faster better like new distributions capture extent least underlying causal mechanisms world last question made fall love artificial intelligence look back first moment life fascinated either human mind artificial mind know adolescent reading lot started

ask terms nature reality fundamental nature reality god play dice dont know factors dont know factors could important looks like god plays dice describe philosophy distinguish two positions positions instrumentalism youre creating theory prediction position realism youre trying understand god describe instrumentalism realism little bit example mechanical laws law true always everywhere law allow predict position moving element believe believe gods law god created world obey physical law law predictions one instrumentalism predictions believe law god always true everywhere means youre realist youre trying really understand gods thought way see world instrumentalist know im working models model machine learning model see setting try solve resolve setting solve problem two different way point view instrumentalist thats everybody say goal machine learning find rule classification true instrument prediction say goal machine learning learn conditional probability god played use play probability one probability another given situation prediction dont need need rule understanding need conditional probability let step back little bit first talk mentioned read last night parts 1960 paper eugene wigner unreasonable effectiveness mathematics natural sciences beautiful paper way made feel honest confess work past years deep learning heavily applied made feel missing beauty nature way math uncover let step away poetry second see role math life tool poetry sit math limits describe people say math language use god use god believe speak god use god use god use god yeah believe article effectiveness unreasonable effectiveness math youre looking mathematical structures know something reality scientists natural science theyre looking equation trying understand reality machine learning try carefully look equations define conditional probability understand something reality fantasy math reveal simple underlying principles reality perhaps know means simple hard discover discover look see beautiful surprising people see youre looking equation derive equations example talked yesterday least square method people lot fantasy improve least square method youre going step step solving equations suddenly get term thinking understand describes position observation point least square method throw lot information dont look composition point observations looking residuals understood thats simple idea simple understand derive equations simple algebra steps take something surprising think understand proof human intuition rich primitive see simple situations let take step back general yes human opposed intuition ingenuity moments brilliance hard human intuition moments brilliance human intuition leap ahead math math catch dont think think best human intuition putting axioms technical see axioms take correctly take axioms axiom polished generations scientists integral wisdom beautifully put maybe look think einstein special relativity role imagination coming first moment discovery idea obviously mix math box imagination dont know whatever exclude imagination whatever saw machine learning comes imagination like features like deep learning relevant problem looking carefully mathematical equations deriving simple theory goes far beyond theoretically whatever people imagine good fantasy interpretation fantasy need dont need imagination derive main principle machine learning think learning intelligence maybe thinking human brain trying describe mathematically process learning something like happens human brain think tools currently think ever tools try describe process learning description going interpretation interpretation vision wrong know one guy invented microscope levenhuk first time got instrument kept secret microscope wrote report london academy science report looking blood looked everywhere water blood sperm described blood like fight queen king saw blood cells red cells imagined army fighting interpretation situation sent report academy science carefully looked believed right saw something yes gave wrong interpretation believe happen brain brain yeah important part know believe human language proverbs much wisdom example people say better thousand days diligent studies one day great teacher ask teacher nobody knows intelligence know history math machine learning teacher lot mathematical point view great teacher dont know thats open question say teacher introduce invariants predicate creating invariants dont know teacher knows reality describe reality predicate invariants knows youre using invariant decrease number observations hundred times maybe try pull apart little bit think mentioned like piano teacher saying student play like butterfly yeah play piano play guitar long time yeah maybe romantic poetic feels like theres lot truth statement like lot instruction statement pull apart language may contain information blah blah blah blah blah blah affects affects affects playing yes laying feels like information exchanged nature information representation information believe sort predicate dont know exactly intelligence machine learning yes rest mathematical technique think discovered recently two mechanism learning one called strong convergence mechanism weak convergence mechanism people use one convergence weak convergence mechanism use predicate thats play like butterfly immediately affect playing know english proverb great looks like duck swims like duck quack like duck probably duck yes exact predicate looks like duck means saw many ducks youre training data description looks integral looks ducks yeah visual characteristics duck yeah want model recognition would like theoretical description model coincide empirical description saw territory looks like duck general swims like duck know duck swims say play chess like duck okay duck doesnt play chess completely legal predicate useless half teacher recognize useless predicate dont use predicate existing machine learning need zillions data english proverb use three predicate looks like duck swims like duck quack like duck cant deny fact swims like duck quacks like duck humor ambiguity lets talk swim like duck doesnt say jump like duck relevant means know ducks know different birds know animals derive relevant say swim like duck underneath order us understand swims like duck feels like need know millions little pieces information pick along way dont think doesnt need knowledge base statements carries rich information helps us understand essence duck yeah far integrating predicates know consider complete theory machine learning lot functions youre talking looks like duck see training data training data recognize like expected duck look remove functions look like think look training data decrease amount function pick one give second predicate decrease set function pick best function find standard machine learning need many examples predicates arent good means predicates good every predicate invented decrease admissible set function talk admissible set functions talk good functions makes good function admissible set function set function small capacity small diversity small vc dimension example contain good function inside way people dont know vc youre v vc would describe lay person vc theory would describe vc machine machine capable pick one function admissible set function set admissible function big contain continuous functions useless dont many examples pick function small small call capacity maybe better called diversity different function set infinite set function diverse small vc dimension vc dimension small need small amount training data goal create admissible set functions small vc dimension contain good function able pick function using small amount observations task learning yeah creating set admissible functions small vc dimension youve figure clever way picking goal learning formulated yesterday statistical learning theory involve creating admissible set function classical learning theory everywhere 100 textbook set function admissible set function given science nothing difficult problem create admissible set functions given say lot functions continuum set function create admissible set functions means finite vc dimension small vc dimension contain good function consideration whats process mean fascinating process creating admissible set functions invariant thats invariant yeah youre looking properties training data properties means function count value average value function training data model expectation function model coincide problem pick functions function fact true functions talking say duck jumping dont ask question jump like duck trivial jumping doesnt help recognize jump know something question ask youre asking seems like duck looks like duck general situation looks like say guy illness disease legal general type predicate looks like special type predicate related specific problem intelligence part business teacher involved incorporating specialized predicates think deep learning neural networks arbitrary architectures helping accomplish tasks youre thinking effectiveness lack thereof weaknesses possible strengths know think fantasy everything like deep learning like features let give example one greatest books churchill book history second world war started book describing old time war great kings gathered together almost relatives discussed done create peace came agreement happened first world war general public came power greedy robbed germany clear everybody peace peace last 20 years professionals see machine learning mathematicians looking problem deep point view mathematical point view computer scientists mostly know mathematics interpretation invented lot blah blah blah interpretations like deep learning need deep learning mathematic know deep learning mathematic know neurons function like say piecewise linear function say class piecewise linear function invent something try prove advantage interpretations mostly wrong enough appeal brain know nothing nobody knows whats going brain think reliable work math mathematical problem best solve problem try understand one way convergence strong way convergence weak way convergence requires predicate go stuff see dont need deep learning even would say one theory called represented theory says optimal solution mathematical problem described learning shadow network deep learning shallow network yeah ultimate problem absolutely end youre saying exactly right question value throwing something table playing math like neural network said throwing something bucket biological example looking kings queens cells microscope dont see value imagining cells kings queens using inspiration imagination math eventually lead think interpretation basically deceives way thats productive think youre trying analyze business learning especially discussion deep learning discussion interpretation things say things thats right arent surprised beauty mathematical beauty fact works criticizing beauty human desire interpret find silly interpretations constructs let ask surprised inspire feel success system like alphago beating game go using neural networks estimate quality board quality position interpretation quality board yeah yes yeah interpretation fact neural network system doesnt matter learning system dont think mathematically understand well beats best human player something thought impossible means difficult problem empirically weve empirically discovered difficult problem yeah true maybe cant argue even would say use deep learning effective way learning theory usually people use deep learning theyre using zillions training data yeah dont need describe challenge problems well deep learning method deep net using hundred times less training data even problems deep learning cannot solve necessary create admissible set function create deep architecture means create admissible set functions cannot say youre creating good admissible set functions fantasy come us possible create admissible set functions training data actually mathematicians consider variant need use law large numbers youre making training existing algorithm need uniform law large numbers much difficult requires vc dimension stuff nevertheless use weak strong way convergence decrease lot training data could three swims like duck quacks like duck lets step back think human intelligence general clearly evolved non mathematical way wasnt far know god whoever didnt come model place brain admissible functions kind evolved dont know maybe view alan turing 50s paper asked rejected question machines think useful question briefly entertain useful useless question machines think talk intelligence view dont know know turing described imitation computer imitate human lets call intelligent understands thinking computer completely understands hes set problem imitation understand problem imitation im sure intelligence inside us may also outside us several observations prove theorem difficult theorem couple years several places people prove theorem say sawyer lemma us done another guys proved theorem history science happened time example geometry happened simultaneously first lobachevsky gauss boyai another guys approximately 10 times period 10 years period time saw lot examples like many mathematicians think develop something develop something general affect everybody maybe model intelligence inside us incorrect interpretation might exists connection world intelligence dont know youre almost like plugging yeah exactly contributing big network big maybe network flip side maybe comment big complexity see classifying algorithms worst case running time relation input way thinking functions think p equals np think thats interesting question yeah interesting question let talk complexity worst case scenario mathematical setting came united states 1990 people know know statistical learning theory russia published monographs monographs america didnt know learned somebody told worst case theory create real case theory till mathematical using mathematics clear understanding clear description reason introduce complexity need using actually diversity like one see mention prove theorems also create theory case know probability measure best case happen entropy theory mathematical point view know best possible case worst possible case derive different model medium interesting think edges interesting edges interesting easy get good bound exact bound many cases bound exact interesting principles discover mass think interesting challenging reveals interesting principles allow get bounds think interesting actually useful understanding essence function algorithm like judging life human worst thing best thing versus stuff middle seems productive dont think cannot describe situation middle general describe edges cases clear model cannot describe model every new case never accurate youre using model statistical point view way youve studied functions nature learning world dont think real world long tail edge cases far away mean stuff middle dont know think point view use formal statistic need uniform law large numbers use invariance business need law large numbers theres huge difference uniform law large numbers large numbers useful describe little take example im talking duck give three predicates enough try formal distinguish need lot observations means information looks like duck contain lot bit information formal bits information dont know much bit information contain things artificial intelligence subject analysis till business dont like people consider artificial intelligence consider us codes imitate activity human science applications would like imitate go ahead useful good problem need learn something people try people develop say predicates seems like duck play like butterfly something like teacher says came mind choose image process problem intelligence problem intelligence see connected problem learning absolutely immediately give predicate like specific predicate seems like duck quack like duck chosen somehow line work would say formulate set open problems take us play like butterfly well get system able lets separate two stories one mathematical story predicate something another story get predicate intelligence problem people even start understand intelligence understand intelligence first try understand teachers teacher teach one teacher better another one yeah think really even havent started journey generating predicates dont understand even dont understand problem exists hear know name want understand one teacher better another affect teacher student repeating problem textbook makes remarks makes philosophy reasoning yeah thats beautiful formulation question open problem one teacher better another right better yeah every level get better mean better whole yeah yeah whatever model one teacher give good predicate one teacher say swims like dog another say jump like dog jump like dog carries zero information exciting problem statistical learning youve ever worked working finished invariant story im happy believe ultimate learning story least show another mechanism two mechanisms separate statistical part intelligent part know nothing intelligent part know intelligent part help us lot teaching learning learning yeah know see example talk last slide challenge say nist digit recognition problem deep learning claims well say 995 correct answers use 60000 observations using hundred times less incorporating invariants means know digit one two three looking explain invariant keep use hundred examples say hundred times less examples job yeah last slide unfortunately talk ended quickly last slide powerful open challenge formulation essence exact problem intelligence everybody machine learning started developed mathematicians immediately recognized use much training data humans needed came story decrease problem learning like deep learning use zillions training data maybe zillions enough good invariants maybe never collect number observations question intelligence statistical part ready soon supply us predicate good job small amount observations first challenge well known digit recognition know digits please tell invariants think say digit three would introduce concept horizontal symmetry digit three horizontal symmetry say say digit two something like soon get idea horizontal symmetry mathematically invent lot measure horizontal symmetry vertical symmetry diagonal symmetry whatever idea symmetry else think digit see meta predicate shape something like symmetry like dark whole picture something like self rise predicate think predicate could rise something general meaning feels like able understand difference two three would need childhood 10 15 years playing kids going school yelled parents walking jumping looking ducks would able generate right predicate telling difference two three think theres efficient way dont know know sure must know something digits yes thats powerful statement yeah maybe several languages description elements digits im talking symmetry properties geometry im talking something abstract dont know problem intelligence one articles trivial show every example carry one bit information real show example say one remove say function tell one say best strategy perfectly remove half functions use one predicate looks like duck remove much functions half means contains lot bit information formal point view general picture want recognize general picture world invent predicate predicate carries lot information beautifully put maybe math show work profound mathematical work field learning ai math general hear lot poetry philosophy really kind talk philosophy science theres poetry music lot work youre way youre thinking come escape poetry escape music think exists ground truth exists ground truth yeah seen everywhere smart guy philosopher sometimes im surprised deep see sometimes see completely subject ground truth see music music ground truth yeah poetry many poets believe take dictation piece music piece empirical evidence gave sense touching something ground truth structure structure math music yeah youre listening bach see structure clear classic simple math axioms geometry feeling poetry sometimes see look back childhood grew russia maybe born researcher russia youve developed researcher russia youve came united states places look back happiest moments researcher profound moments terms impact society terms impact damn good feel day remember moment know every time found something great life every simple things general feeling time wrong go try honest front make interpretation try understand related ground truth blah blah blah interpretation something like youre allowed get excited possibility discovery oh yeah double check related another ground truth temporary forever know always feeling found something big 20 years ago discovered statistical learning theory nobody believed except one guy dudley mit 20 years became fashion support vector machines kernel machines support vector machines learning theory working sense sense profundity seems right seems powerful right absolutely immediately recognized last forever found invariant story feeling complete learning proof different mechanisms cosmetic improvement terms invariants need invariants statistical learning work together also im happy formulate intelligence separate technical part completely different absolutely well vladimir thank much talking today thank honor',\n",

two family soviet union context view human nature humans inherently good inherently evil good evil within us guido van rossum ouch expect deep one guess good evil potential us lot depends circumstances context peter bell world least soviet union side europe sort suffering challenge kind set traumatic events often emerges beautiful art music literature interview read heard said enjoyed dutch literature child tell books influence childhood guido van rossum well teenager favorite writer favorite dutch author guy named willem frederik hermans whos writing certainly early novels sort ambiguous things happened world war two think young adult time wrote lot interesting good books thought think peter bell nonfiction way guido van rossum fiction much set ambiguous world resistance germans often couldnt tell whether someone truly resistance really spy germans characters novels sort crossed line never really find exactly happened peter bell novels theres always good guy bad guy nature good evil clear theres hero guido van rossum heroes often main characters often anti heroes theyre heroic theyre often fail level accomplish lofty goals peter bell looking trajectory rest life literature dutch english translation impact outside technical world existed guido van rossum still read novels dont think impacts much directly peter bell doesnt impact work guido van rossum separate world work highly technical sort world art literature doesnt really directly bearing peter bell dont think theres creative element design know would say design language art guido van rossum im disagreeing im saying sort dont feel direct influences traditional art creativity peter bell right course dont feel doesnt mean somehow deeply subconscious guido van rossum knows peter bell knows lets go back early teens hobbies building electronic circuits building mechanical models put back mind young guido 12 13 14 grounded desire create system create something tinkering joy puzzle solving guido van rossum think latter actually maybe towards end high school period felt confident enough designed circuits sort interesting somewhat lot time literally took model kit follow instructions putting things together mean think first years built electronics kits really enough understanding sort electronics really understand mean could debug could sort follow instructions carefully always stayed naive model like build circuit like transistor works dont think days understanding coils capacitors actually sort major problem started build complex digital circuits unaware sort analog part – actually work would things – schematic looked – everything looked fine didnt work didnt realize megahertz level oscillation throwing circuit sort – two wires close switches kind poorly built time think really interesting instructive think echoes time 1970s personal computer born sense tinkering circuits sense encroaching revolution personal computing point would sit ask predict 80s 90s think would able successfully unroll process thats happening clue remember think summer senior year – maybe summer junior year – well point think 18 went trip math olympiad eastern europe like – part dutch team nerdy kids sort different experiences one told amazing thing called computer never heard word explorations electronics sort simple digital circuits sort – idea somewhat understood digital calculator worked maybe echoes computers never made connection didnt know parents paying magazine subscriptions using punched cards something called computer involved read cards transferred money accounts also really interested things went university study math found computer students allowed use – youre supposed talk computer programming feel like finding – yeah thing could computer wasnt really connected real world thing could sort – typed program bunch punched cards gave punched cards operator hour later operator gave back printout could write program something abstract dont even remember first forays programming sort simple math exercises learn programming language worked sense okay first year college see computer youre able program generates output start seeing possibility continuation tinkering circuits start imagine one personal computer see something tool like word processing tool maybe gaming something start imagine could going world robotics like frankenstein picture could create artificial theres like another entity front see computer dont think really saw way really interested tinkering maybe sort complete coincidence ended sort creating programming language tool programmers ive always focused sort activity programming much happens program write right remember dont remember maybe second third year probably second actually someone pointed thing called conways game life youre probably familiar think – 70s think came scientific american column someone monthly column mathematical diversions im also blanking guys name famous time think 90s one columns conways game life illustrations wrote rules sort suggestion philosophically interesting conway called like two pages photocopy article dont even remember got spoke remember implementing version game batch computer using whole pascal program sort read initial situation input read numbers said many generations print every many generations would come pages pages sort things remember much later ive done similar thing using python original version wrote time found interesting combined trick learned electronics hobbyist times essentially first paper designed simple circuit built logic gates took nine bits input sort cell neighbors produced new value cell like combination half adder clipping actually full adder worked translated series boolean operations pascal integers could use integers bitwise values could basically generate 60 bits generation like eight instructions nice proud funny mentioned people dont know conways game life cellular automata theres single compute units kind look neighbors figure look like next generation based state neighbors deeply distributed system concept least theres simple rules follow somehow simple rule step back look occurs beautiful theres emergent complexity even though underlying rules simple theres emergent complexity funny thing youve implemented thing youre commenting youre proud hack make run efficiently youre commenting beautiful implementation youre commenting fact theres emergent complexity youve coded simple program step back print following generation generation thats stuff may predicted would happen happening magic mean thats magic us feel program create program run whether hello world shows something screen theres graphical component seeing magic mechanism creating think went back forth student incredibly small budget computer time could use actually measured got trouble one professors overspent departments budget different story actually wanted efficient implementation also wanted explore would happen larger number generations larger size board implementation flawless would feed different patterns think maybe follow article patterns like gliders patterns repeated number generations translated one two positions right something like remember things like glider guns well google conways game life people still go aww ooh reason really well understood mean stephen wolfram obsessed dont mathematical tools describe kind complexity emerges kinds systems way run im convinced sort problem lends classic mathematical analysis one theory create artificial intelligence artificial kind game life kind create universe let run creating scratch design way coding python program creates fully intelligent system may quite challenging might need create universe like game life might experiment lot different universes set rules doesnt essentially always end repeating trivial way yeah stephen wolfram works simple rules says kind surprising quickly find rules create interesting things shouldnt able somehow maybe universe laden rules create interesting things might look like humans emergent phenomena thats interesting may difficult create think sure let sort ask time world least popular press kind captivated perhaps least america idea artificial intelligence computers would able think pretty soon touch science fiction reality way didnt really start reading science fiction much much later think teenager read maybe one bundle science fiction stories background somewhere like thoughts sort using computers build something intelligent always felt try design language different tasks programmer useful different tools available sort suitable different tasks still write c code still write shell code write things python still use languages sometimes task demands well would say time task actually demands certain language task write program solves problem x scratch like fix bug existing program x add small feature existing large program even youre constrained choice language context like still fact write certain language balance long take write code long code run youre phase exploring solutions often spend much time writing code running every time youve run see output quite wanted spend time coding language like python makes iteration much faster fewer details get right program compiles runs libraries sorts stuff sort quickly take bunch existing components put together get prototype application running like building electronics using breadboard time sprawl circuit shook would stop working put together well functioned wanted see worked move next schematic design add something youve sort figured oh perfect design radio light sensor whatever say okay design pcb solder components small space make robust say voltage fluctuations mechanical disruption know nothing comes designing electronics know lot comes writing code initial steps efficient fast theres much stuff gets way youre kind describing like darwin described evolution species right youre observing true python take step back act creating languages art three months initial steps specified bunch goals sort things observe python perhaps goals create rules syntactic structure features result beginning follow questions evolution python beginning sitting creating lexical analyzer whatever python still big part sort said dont want design everything scratch im going borrow features languages like oh interesting basically exactly first observe like yeah thats youre 17 years old want sort create programming language youre going successful experience languages whereas lets say mid 30s written parsers worked implementation abc spent years debating design abc authors designers nothing design designed fully ended implemented joined team borrow ideas concepts concrete sort local rules different languages like indentation certain syntactic features abc chose borrow string literals numbers work c various things take yet youve funny sounding think surprisingly accurate least practical title benevolent dictator life quite know last three decades whatever actual title functionally speaking make decisions design decisions maybe lets take python 2 releasing python 3 example backward compatible python 2 ways lot people know deliberation discussion decision like yeah psychology experience regret aspects experience undergone well yeah group process really point even though bdfl name certainly everybody sort respected position creator current sort owner language design looking everyone else feedback sort python 30 sense sparked people community pointing oh well issues sort bite users something python 3 took number python words called time said try sort make small changes language address words sort past always taken backwards compatibility seriously many python words earlier versions already resolved could resolved maintaining backwards compatibility sort using gradual path evolution language certain area stuck number words widely recognized problems like roadblocks nevertheless sort things people trip know thats always thing people trip trip could think backwards compatible way resolving issues still option resolve issues right yes long time sort resigned well okay language going perfect way way way sort certain mean still plenty things say well particular detail better java r visual basic whatever okay well cant easily change bad little bit user education static analyzer warnings parse something things thought well really problems going away getting worse future something ultimately decision made right toughest decision history python make benevolent dictator life maybe even smaller scale decision really torn well toughest decision probably resign right lets go hold second let interest time cool questions lets touch really important one quite dramatic beautiful certain kinds ways july year three months ago wrote pep 572 done dont ever want fight hard pep find many people despise decisions would like remove entirely decision process ill still ordinary core developer ill still available mentor people possibly available im basically giving permanent vacation bdfl benevolent dictator life first almost shakespearean im going appoint successor going create democracy anarchy dictatorship federation dramatic beautiful set statements almost open ended nature called community create future python kind beautiful aspect dramatic know making decision like heart mind stepping back months later im glad liked writing actually written pretty quickly literally something like months months going around circles finally approved pep572 big hand design although didnt initiate originally sort gave bunch nudges direction would better language sorry ask async io thats one pep572 actually small feature assignment expressions lot debate lot people claimed knew pythonic pythonic knew going destroy language like violation pythons fundamental design philosophy thought bullshit favor would think know something pythons design philosophy really tired also stressed thing literally sort announcing going accept certain wednesday evening finally sent email accepted go implement went bed feeling really relieved thats behind wake thursday morning 7 think well last one thats going terrible debate thats last time let stressed pep decision resign ive sort thinking retirement half decade ive joking sort mentioning retirement sort telling community point future im going retire dont take fl part title literally thought okay im done day wanted good time wife going little beach town nearby think maybe 15 20 minutes wrote thing called shakespearean funny thing didnt even realize monumental decision five minutes later read link message back twitter people already discussing twitter guido resigned bdfl posted internal forum thought read core developers thought would least one day news would sort get aspects also element quite quite powerful element uncertainty lies ahead also briefly talk example play guitar hobby fun whenever play people super positive super friendly theyre like awesome great sometimes enter outside observer enter programming community seems sometimes camps whatever topic two camps two plus camps often pretty harsh criticizing opposing camps onlooker may totally wrong think yeah holy wars sort favorite activity programming community psychology behind okay healthy community productive force ultimately evolution language well everybody patting back never telling truth would good thing think middle ground sort nasty okay middle ground healthy ongoing criticism feedback productive mean every level see mean someone proposes fix small issue code base chances reviewer sort respond saying well actually better way comes deciding future python core developer community think five six competing proposals constitution future fear future hope future im confident future large think debate healthy productive actually wrote resignation email knew python good spot python core developer community group 50 100 people sort write review code goes python people get along well time large number different areas expertise represented different levels experience python core dev community different levels experience completely outside software development general large systems small systems embedded systems felt okay resigning knew community really take care grab bag future feature developments let ask comment maybe quickly concurrent programming parallel computing async io things people expressed hope complained whatever discussed reddit async io parallelization general packaging totally clueless used pip install stuff apparently theres pipenv poetry theres dependency packaging systems manage dependencies theyre emerging theres lot confusion whats right thing use also functional programming going get functional programming kind idea course gil connected parallelization suppose global interpreter lock problem comment whichever want comment well lets take gil parallelization async io one topic im hopeful python develop sort high concurrency high parallelism language thats sort way language designed way users use language way language implemented make pretty unlikely future think might even need really way people use might something great concern think async io special case sort allows overlapping io io sort best practice supporting high throughput io many connections per second im worried think async io evolve couple competing packages smart people sort pushing us make async io better parallel computing think python language ways work around cant expect write algorithm python compiler automatically parallelize use package like numpy bunch powerful packages sort use cpus available tell package heres data heres abstract operation apply go back c world packages implemented usually c thats tensorflow packages come parallelize across gpus example take care terms packaging comment future packaging python packaging always least favorite topic really tough problem os platform want packaging packaging solution specific language take linux two competing packaging solutions linux unix general work across languages several languages like node javascript ruby python packaging solutions work within ecosystem language use tough problem approach use system packaging system install python use python packaging system install third party python packages thats people ten years ago python packaging really terrible situation nowadays pip future separate ecosystem numerical scientific python based anaconda two live together dont think need thats packaging well least thats ive extremely happy didnt even know issue brought interest time let sort skip million questions watched five half hour oral history youve done computer history museum nice thing gave linear progression interview gave feeling life know life well lived interesting things sort pretty would say good spend little existence earth outside family looking back journey really proud moments stand accomplishments ideas creation python stands thing look back say damn pretty good well would say python definitely best thing ive ever done wouldnt sort say creation python way sort raised python like baby didnt conceive child raised child im setting child free world ive set child sort able take care im proud announcer monty pythons flying circus used say something completely different favorite monty python moment moment hitchhikers guide literature show movie cracks think always play dead parrot sketch oh thats brilliant thats favorite well pushing daisies okay greta thank much talking today lex great conversation felt much understanding actually goes inside computer knew many bits memory difficult program sort didnt believe could build something intelligent would really sort satisfy definition intelligence think influential thing read early twenties gödel escherbach consciousness big eye opener sense sense brain time see brain computer total separation way yeah youre pragmatically practically know limits memory limits sequential computing weakly paralyzed computing know hard see creates also easy see 40s 50s 60s least similarities brain computers oh yeah mean totally believe brains computers sense mean rules use play pretty different rules sort implement current hardware dont believe like separate thing infuses us intelligence consciousness theres soul ive atheist probably 10 years old thinking bit math universe well parents atheists know could atheist still believe something sort intelligence consciousness cannot possibly emerge fixed set rules camp totally see sort given many millions years evolution took time dna particular machine sort encodes information unlimited amount information chemical form figured way replicate thought maybe 300 million years ago thought closer half billion years ago thats sort originated hasnt really changed sort structure dna hasnt changed ever since like binary code hardware mean basic programming language hasnt changed maybe programming obviously sort happened set rules good enough sort develop endless variability sort idea self replicating molecules competing resources one type eventually sort always taking happened fossils dont know exactly happened believe clear happen comment consciousness see think well talk programming quite bit well talk know intelligence connecting programming fundamentally consciousness whole thing think often developer programming language human pretty sort separate topics sort line work working programming involve anything goes direction developing intelligence consciousness sort privately avid reader popular science writing thoughts mostly dont actually believe consciousness nothing thing feeling forget read influenced feel look cat dog mouse form intelligence look fish form intelligence evolution took long time feel sort evolution intelligence led sort human form intelligence followed evolution senses especially visual sense mean enormous amount processing thats needed interpret scene humans still better computers feeling sort reason like mammals particular developed levels consciousness eventually sort going intelligence self awareness consciousness sort robot highly developed senses lot rich sensory information coming thats really interesting thought whatever basic mechanism dna whatever basic building blocks programming add abilities high resolution sensors sensors keep stacking things top basic programming trying survive develops interesting things start us humans appear like intelligence consciousness far robots go think self driving cars sort greatest opportunity developing something like drive dont pay attention rules road also look around get clues oh shopping district oh heres old lady crossing street oh someone carrying pile mail theres mailbox bet theyre going cross street reach mailbox slow dont even think much turn observations understanding consciousnesses going systems world going oh tree going fall see sort see much expect somehow anything going become unconscious going self driving car network bazillion computers google amazon data center networked together whatever sense actually highlight thats work thomas vehicles highlight big gap currently cant truly need able solve problem formulation consciousness intelligence something basically system order interact us humans opposed kind abstract notion consciousness consciousness something need able empathize able fear understand fear death aspects important interacting pedestrians need able basic computation based human desires thoughts sort yeah look dog dog clearly knows mean im dog owner friends dogs dogs clearly know humans around going least model humans going learn dogs know youre going want go theyre sad leave alone cry theyre afraid mistreated younger dont assign sort consciousness dogs least much also dont think none think consciousness intelligence nothing spectrum really interesting returning programming languages way think building kinds things building intelligence building consciousness building artificial beings think one exciting ideas came 17th century leibniz hobbes descartes theres feeling convert thought reasoning thing find special brains convert logic formalize formal reasoning formalize everything knowledge calculate thats brains calculating theres whole idea possible actually program werent aware concept pattern matching sense aware sort thought discovered incredible bits mathematics like newtons calculus sort idealism sort extension could logic math sort went along lines thought theres like yeah logic theres like bunch rules bunch input didnt realize recognize face bunch rules shit ton data plus circuit sort interprets visual clues context everything else somehow massively parallel pattern match stored rules mean see tomorrow front dropbox office might recognize even im wearing different shirt yeah see tomorrow coffee shop belmont might idea beach whatever make kind mistakes time see someone know like oh person colleague wifes see movies didnt recognize see call pattern matching see rules unable encode everything see pieces information look around room im wearing black shirt certain height im human theres probably tens thousands facts pick moment moment scene take granted aggregate together understand scene dont think could encoded end day put table calculate dont know means mean yes sense actual magic enough layers abstraction facts enter eyes ears understanding scene dont think ai really covered enough distance like take human body realize built atoms well uselessly reductionist view right body built organs organs built cells cells built proteins proteins built amino acids amino acids built atoms get quantum mechanics thats pragmatic view mean obviously engineer agree kind view also consider sam harris view well intelligence information processing like said take sensory information stuff come actions intelligent makes sound easy dont know sam harris oh well philosopher like philosophers often think right essentially thats descartes wait minute like said magic basically says doesnt appear like theres magic know little might well magic know made atoms know made organs fact know little get atoms organs way thats recreatable means shouldnt get excited yet fact figured made atoms right taking facts sensory organs take turning reasons actions sort lot abstractions havent quite figured deal mean sometimes dont know go tangent take simple program parses say compiler parses program sense input routine compiler parser sensing organ builds mighty complicated internal representation program saw doesnt linear sequence bytes representing text program anymore abstract syntax tree dont know many viewers listeners familiar compiler technology theres… fewer fewer days right thats also true probably people want take shortcut theres sort abstraction data structure compiler uses produce outputs relevant like translation program machine code executed hardware data structure gets thrown away fish fly sees sort gets visual impulses im sure also builds data structure fly may minimal fly may mean case flys brain could imagine enough layers abstraction much darker well sense motion fly sort responds move arm towards clearly visual processing intelligent well intelligent abstraction motion still similar things much complicated brains mean otherwise couldnt drive car couldnt didnt incredibly good abstraction motion yeah sense abstraction motion probably one primary sources information us know think know weve built abstractions top build much complicated data structures based build persistent data structures sort processing information sort gets stored memory pretty much permanently available recall mean things sort youre conscious youre remembering like give phone number well age write could imagine could remember seven numbers ten digits reproduce sort repeat times thats fairly conscious form memorization hand recognize face idea brain whole bunch specialized hardware knows recognize faces dont know much sort coded dna much trained ages zero three somehow brains know lots things like useful interactions humans without really conscious done anymore right actual day day lives operating highest level abstraction even conscious little details underlying theres compilers top like turtles top turtles turtles way theres compilers way thats essentially say theres magic thats trying get think descartes started whole train saying theres magic mean theres beforehand well didnt descartes also notion though soul body fundamentally separate separate yeah think write god political reasons dont know actually im historian theres notions reasoning human thought formalized think continued 20th century russell gadots incompleteness theorem debate limits things could formalized thats turing machine came along exciting idea mean underlying lot computing quite lot computer encode lot stuff talking terms recognizing faces theoretically algorithm run computer context id like ask programming philosophical way mean program computer said write python program compiled c program compiles byte code forming layers youre programming layer abstraction thats higher see programming context keep getting higher higher levels abstraction think point higher levels abstraction called programming resemble call programming moment source code mean still source code sort lower level machine like still molecules electrons sort proteins brains theres still programming system administration knows keep machine running machine different level abstraction sense far understand way last decade people made progress things like facial recognition self driving cars endless endless amounts training data least lay person feel totally lay person field looks like researchers publish results dont necessarily know exactly algorithms work often get upset sort read sort fluff piece facebook newspaper social networks say well algorithms thats like totally different interpretation word algorithm way trained learned eight ten years old algorithm set rules completely understand mathematically analyzed prove things like prove aristotelian sieve produces prime numbers prime numbers yeah dont know know andrej karpathy im afraid hes head ai tesla stanford cheeky way calling concept software 20 let disentangle second kind youre referring traditional algorithm concept algorithm something thats clear read understand prove functioning kind software 10 software 20 exactly described neural networks type machine learning feed bunch data neural network learns function specify inputs outputs want cant look inside cant analyze train function map inputs outputs giving lot data thats programming becomes getting lot data thats programming well would programming 20 programming 20 wouldnt call programming different activity like building organs cells called chemistry well lets step back think sort generally course know like parent teaching kids things called programming sense thats programming used youre providing data examples use cases imagine writing function loops clearly readable text saying well heres lot examples function take heres lot examples takes functions figure rest thats 20 concept question like fuzzy way reality lot pattern recognition systems fuzzy way quote unquote programming think kind world called something totally different programming youre software engineer mean youre designing systems systematically tested evaluated specific specification fuzzy software 20 world machine learning world thats something else totally intermixing thats possible well question probably asked dont quite know software 20 actually think truism every task ai tackled past point realized done longer considered part artificial intelligence longer necessary use term oh know new field science engineering developed dont know sort every form learning sort controlling computer systems always called programming dont know maybe im focused much terminology expect different concepts people sort different education different model theyre trying develop concepts guess could comment another way put concept think kind functions neural networks provide things opposed able upfront prove work cases throw youre able worst case analysis versus average case analysis youre able say seems everything weve tested work 999 time cant guarantee fails unexpected ways cant even give examples fails unexpected ways like really good time room current ways think programming programming 10 actually sort getting point sort ideal bug free program abandoned long ago software developers care bugs manifest often enough annoying willing take occasional crash outage incorrect result granted cant possibly dont enough programmers make code bug free would incredibly tedious business try throw formal methods becomes even tedious every user clicks link somehow get error average user doesnt panic click see works better second time often magically go try way performing tasks thats sort end end recovery mechanism inside systems sorts retries timeouts fallbacks imagine sort biological systems even full otherwise wouldnt survive think programming taught thought exactly said come kind youre always denying fact always sort basic programming education sort programs youre students write small simple bug always find fix sort programming taught even elementary middle schools high school introduction programming classes college typically programming small classes sort actually teach software engineering building large systems every summer dropbox large number interns every tech company west coast thing interns always amazed first time life see goes really large software development environment everything theyve learned college almost always much smaller scale somehow difference scale makes qualitative difference things think take steps back decades 70s 80s first thinking python world programming languages ever think would systems large underlying google facebook dropbox thinking python actually always caught surprise sort yeah pretty much every stage computing maybe youve spoken interviews think evolution programming languages fascinating especially leads perspective towards greater greater degrees intelligence learned first programming language played russia turtle logo logo yeah look list programming languages ive played little bit mean theyre beautiful different ways fortran cobalt lisp algol 60 basic logo c object oriented came along 60s simula pascal smalltalk leads theyre classics classics yeah classic hits right steam thats built top lisp database side sql c leads python pascal thats python matlab kind different communities different languages talk world know sort python came abc actually never knew language researched conversation went back abc looks remarkably lot annoying qualities underneath like caps underneath theres elements python quite theyre already thats got good stuff good stuff world youre swimming programming languages focused good stuff specific circle sense everyone chasing said every programming language built scratch itch aware itches community yes mean itch trying scratch python well im glad wasnt aware itches would probably able anything mean youre trying solve every problem youll solve nothing well yeah overwhelming focused problem wanted programming language sat somewhere shell scripting c arguably like one higher level one lower level python sort language intermediate level although still pretty much high level end thinking much want tool use productive programmer specific environment also given time budget development tool sort three months design like thinking features language syntactically semantically implement whole pipeline parsing source code executing think timeline goals seems like productivity core goal like 90s first decade 21st century always machine learning ai programming research always c people little mechanical engineering electrical engineering matlabby theyre little bit matlab focused world maybe little bit java people interested emphasizing object oriented nature things within last 10 years especially oncoming neural networks packages built python interface neural networks switched python ive noticed significant boost cant exactly dont think cant exactly put words im much much productive able get job done much much faster think whatever qualitative difference dont know quantitative could feeling dont know im actually productive think probably yeah well thats right think theres elements let speak one aspect think affecting productivity c really enjoyed creating performant code creating beautiful structure everything know kind going especially newer newer standards templated programming really creating beautiful formal structure found spending time opposed getting parsing file extracting keywords whatever task trying python think productivity general designing sort decades last three decades think means productive programmer',\n",

course artificial general intelligence artificial intelligence podcast enjoy subscribe youtube itunes podcast provider choice simply connect twitter lex friedman spelled f r heres conversation jeff atwood co created managed years worlds largest community programmers stack overflow 10 years ago think motivates programmers fame fortune glory process programming sense belonging community puzzles really think idea working puzzles independently people solving problem sort like almost although nobody really works alone programming anymore say theres aspect hiding away beating problem solve like brute force basically lot programming computers fast things would take forever human many times often get answer youre saying pure act tinkering code thing drives problems struggle balance within joy overcoming brute force process pain suffering eventually leads something actually works well datas fun theres thing called shuffling problem naive shuffle programmers write huge flaw theres lot articles online really bad youre casino unsophisticated programmer writing shuffle algorithm theres surprising ways get wrong neat thing way figure run shuffle bunch times see many orientations cards get get equal distribution cards naive method shuffling look data brute force say ok dont know whats going happen write program billion times see buckets look like data monty hall problem another example three doors somebody gives information another door correct answer always switch monty hall problem intuitive freaks people time solve data write program monty hall game never switches always switches compare would immediately see dont smart dont figure answer algorithmically brute force data say well know answer ran program billion times data buckets got empirically find whats joy personally outside family motivates process well honest dont really write lot code anymore discourse managery stuff always despised programmer think managers people dont really anything weird thing code realize language code ability direct people lets get stuff done could anyway said language code language code meaning communication humans yes think systematic like makes get programming makes good manager makes good leader well think leader leading example first sort things want kind exhausting particularly kids realize kids watching time even ways youve stopped seeing hardest person see planet really lot easier see people make judgments youre super biased dont actually see way people see often youre hard way people really arent going thats one insights youve got really diligent thinking behaving way represents want people behave like leading example theres lot examples leaders really mess like make decisions like wow bad example people think leading example one one believe working really hard dont mean working exhaustively showing real passion problem necessarily solution problem problem one really believe like discourse example problem looking current project get people groups communicate way doesnt break howling wolves deal trolling like technical problems get people post paragraphs get people use bold get people use complete sentences although problems well get people get along solve whatever problem set solve reach consensus discussion hurt even maybe discussion doesnt really matter people yelling like thats purpose kind communication would say leadership setting example things represent want making sure youre actually things theres trick things dont also say lot yeah lets pause one two things fascinating leader self awareness said really hard self aware personally maybe leaders youve seen look know things youre wrong things way speak others way behave things youre get signal think theres two aspects one like processing feedback youre getting get feedback well right getting feedback right one way example discourse three cofounders periodically talk decisions make like one person make mistake like wow misunderstandings things like part like group consensus leadership like good think systems theres one leader leader rule absolute law really dangerous experience communities example like community thats run one person one person makes decisions persons gonna bad day something could happen person something theres lot variables like first think leadership multiple people leadership talk amongst giving feedback decisions theyre making get feedback think theres little voice head right gut wherever wanna put body think voice really important like think people kind moral compass like want people want right thing believe mean might handful sociopaths dont people want people think good person wouldnt right like want people despise mean thats weird right little voice sort angel devil shoulder sort talking like youre youre make feel make decisions right think attunement voice important said voice also think programmer situation sometimes devil shoulder little loud youre little self critical lot developers especially introverted personality struggle self criticism criticism others one things leadership something thats potentially unpopular people doubt still go decision whats balance like think walk people decision making right like blogging really important communication important code language another kind code like program arrived conclusion im gonna reach right one thing say like decision final deal right thats usually satisfying people say look weve thinking problem heres stuff thats happened heres think right heres goals heres wanna achieve weve looked options think available options best option people like oh okay right maybe dont totally agree kind see youre coming see arbitrary decision delivered cloud flames sky right like human trying reach kind consensus goals goals might different thats completely legit right youre making clear like oh well reason dont agree totally different goals right like could agree youre bad person radically different goals mind started looking problem one said passion hard work sorry well tied together mind lets say hard work passion like like really love problem discourse setting solve way like theres vision world devolves facebook basically owning everything every aspect human communication right always kind scary world first cause dont think facebook really good execution got compliment theyre competent terms theyre facebook much moral compass terms facebook cares facebook really dont really care problems care big make facebook right talking company mechanism facebook works kind really right like idea discourse reason im passionate cause believe every community right right like software run belongs thats space set rules dont like move different hosting know whatever need happen happen like idea company town human communication implicitly owned whatsapp instagram facebook really disturbing cause facebook really smart like said theyre great execution buying whatsapp buying instagram incredibly smart decisions also thing dont know know vpn software give away free smartphones indirectly feeds data traffic back facebook see whats actually getting popular vpns right low level access network data users let lets take small pause first discourse talk lay land different ways communities theres stack overflow youve built theres discourse stack overflow kind like wiki wikipedia talk specific scalpel focused purpose discourse maybe contrast facebook first say discourse yeah start beginning well let start beginning stack overflow structured wiki style q programmers right problem first worked started thought discussions looked like programming forums things quickly realized q narrow subset human communication right sorry started stack overflow thought didnt even know q really didnt know would q well didnt know idea like okay things see working online goal right goal site experts exchange unfortunate name thank killing site yeah know right like lot people dont remember anymore great like thats measure success people dont remember thing trying replace youve totally place get answers programming questions wasnt clear like focused q discussion plenty programming forums werent really sure like okay well take aspects dig reddit like voting important reordering answers based votes wiki style stuff like able edit posts posts peoples posts make better keep date ownership blogging like okay im saying voice stuff know reputation accrues peer recognition asked earlier like motivates programmers think peer recognition motivates lot one key insights stack overflow like recognition peers things get done necessarily money necessarily boss like peers saying wow person really knows stuff lot value reputation system came sort frankensteining bunch stuff together stack overflow like stuff seen working knew worked became stack overflow time realized wasnt really discussion focused questions answers wasnt lot room page let talk tangential thing like okay answering question clarifying question could alternative answer question theres usually one way programming theres like say five 10 ways one patterns got early stack overflow questions would like hundreds answers like wow programming question 500 200 500 answers looked realized really questions traditional sense discussions stuff allowed early eventually decided wasnt allowed whats favorite programming food whats funniest programming cartoon youve seen sort backfill bunch rules like isnt allowed real problem youre facing like nobody goes work says wow cant work cause dont know funniest programming cartoon sorry cant compile code right real problem youre facing job run rule second like really learn like call accidental learning reddit style learning youre like oh ill browse things oh wow know know tree frogs live three years mean made dont know thats true didnt really set learn dont need know right accidental learning intentional learning youre like okay problem want learn stuff around problem right could theory could compiler theory could stuff im compiler problem hence need know compiler theory aspect gets answer right kind directed learning backfill rules sort figured heck system came strict time lot people still complain wrote latest blog entry stack overflow want grows celebrating 10 year anniversary yeah yeah 10 years system trended towards strictness theres variety reasons one people dont like see people get reputation stuff view frivolous actually understand saw programmer got like 500 upvotes funniest programming cartoon funniest comment seen code like well reputation wrote joke probably mean maybe cartoon right theyre getting bunch reputation based someone elses work thats even programming joke right related programming begin resent youre like well thats fair isnt level theyre correct mean empathize correct get reputation versus heres really gnarly regular expression problem heres really clever insightful detailed answer laying oh heres youre seeing behavior youre seeing let teach things avoid future thats great thats gold right want people get reputation much wow look funny thing saw right great theres specific qa format take journey towards discourse facebook twitter started beginning stack overflow evolved purpose discourse passion creating community discussion born well part based realization stack overflow good specific subjects based data facts science answers kind verified true another form theres book knowledge like tome knowledge defines whatever refer book itll give answer works subjects theres like semi clear answers things verified form theres always one way theres complete flexibility system around falls stuff like poker lego like go stackexchangecom engine tries launch different qa topics right people propose qa topics sample questions gets enough support within network launched qa site ones launched poker lego horribly right mean might still lingering form experiment like test right subjects work super well stack engine dont reason lego poker dont work theyre social really whats rule poker like well kind cigars like smoke playing poker whats cool set cards use im playing poker whats strategies say hand come strategies could use discussion around whats happening lego thing heres cool lego set found look awesome im like yeah thats freaking awesome right question right theres social components discussions dont fit literally disallow stack overflow social problems youre facing work need concrete answers real demonstrated problem thats blocking something nobodys blocked straight flush blocking problem world opportunity hang discuss discourse way address say look discussion forum software bad came stack overflow early 2012 still bad expected improved four years since last looked improved like well thats kind terrible love communities people talking things love theyre communities interest right theres good software startups would come say hey jeff want startup heres idea first thing would say well first asking dont really know field necessarily arent asking community people interested problem people using product arent talking theyd say oh great idea thats started playing sad trombone realized software involving talking users customers audience patrons whatever really bad stuff would embarrassed recommend people yet thats felt could get biggest strongest effective input product right users community right thats stack overflow talking forums dark matter internet still dont know still longest time passionate fascinating discussions whats usual structure theres usually linear sequential youre posting one theres pagination every theres 10 posts go next page format still used like im lot research tesla vehicles theres tesla motors club forum extremely really wanted run actually pinged us dont think got really would liked gotten one theyve started even 2012 believe like dont want heartbeat thats like fast like youre freaking measure health healthy heartbeat people listening decide means healthy reasonable otherwise youre going frustrated thats build software make mistakes roll live see feels like say oh god terrible idea oh gosh could even better right turn crank faster get ahead competitors ultimately rate change right delta v right fast moving well within year youre going miles away time catch right thats way works plus software developer user love software thats constantly changing dont understand people get super pissed like oh changed software dare im like yes change software change time man thats makes stuff great changed rapidly become something greater granted changes suck admit ive seen many times general thats makes software cool right malleable fighting weird like well youre fighting essence thing youre building doesnt make sense want really embrace hummingbird embrace healthy cycle heartbeat right talk people really dont change true thats probably lot stuff write blog probably remain true well theres flip side coin people dont change like investing understanding people like learning unix 1970 nothing changed right things youve learned people still valid 34 years whereas learn latest javascript framework thats going good like two years right exactly look future programming theres people component theres also technology see future programming change significantly far tell people ultimately programming something foresee changing fundamental way well youve got go look back sort basics programming one things always shocked like source control like didnt learn anything source control granted graduated college 1992 remember hearing people late like 1998 1999 like even maybe today theyre learning source control like well learn source control fundamental working programmers working way dont lose work basic software literal bedrock software development source control compare today like github right like microsoft bought github think incredibly smart acquisition move part anybody wants reasonable source control go sign github set right theres tons walkthroughs tons tutorials concept like programming advanced say 1999 like well hell github mean god yes right like massively advanced whether programming significantly different im going say think baseline view fundamentals continue go actually get better like source control thats one fundamentals gotten hundreds orders magnitude better 10 20 years ago fundamentals let introduce two things maybe comment one mobile phones could fundamentally transform programming maybe maybe comment one artificial intelligence promises ways programming one way think really programmer using intelligence thats inside skull something useful hope artificial intelligence useful parts dont think see smartphones fact everybody one theyre getting powerful potentially changing programming see ai potentially changing programming ok thats good smartphones definitely changed mean since guess 2010 really started getting super popular mean last eight years world literally changed right everybody carries computer around thats normal mean huge change society think still dealing lot positive negative ramifications right everybodys connected time everybodys computer time dream world geek right like careful ask right like wow everybody computer quite utopia thought would right computers used lot stuff thats necessarily great thats central focus smartphone puts computer front everyone granted small touch screen smallish touch screen computer programming dont know dont think ive kind time come subscribe unix view world comes programming want teach basic command line things programming going think long long time dont think theres magical visual programming thats going happen dont know ive time become believer unix philosophy know kind write unix thats going way long long time well continue like said raise baseline tools get better itll get simpler still fundamentally going command line tools fancy ides thats kind foreseeable future im seeing visual programming stuff horizon kind think like smartphone directly analogous programming like im trying think right theres really much necessarily analogous programming kind things kind programs would need write might need different yeah kind languages mean probably also subscribe everything world might written javascript oh yeah thats already happening mean discourse bet discourse javascript another bet side table still try believe would say smartphones mostly cultural shift programming shift question artificial intelligence sort devices predicting youre going think theres strength think artificial intelligence kind overselling terms like people predictable right people things let give example one check put discourse thats lot big commercial websites say log new york city hour later log san francisco like well hmm thats interesting get new york san francisco one hour point youre like ok suspicious login point would alert like ok thats ai right thats heuristic like one hour get 2000 miles right doesnt mean youre grand maybe youre vpn theres ways happen thats basic prediction based idea people pretty much dont move around much may travel occasionally nobody unless youre traveling salesman thats literally traveling world every day theres much repetition predictability terms things youre going think good software anticipates needs example google think called google whatever google thing predicts commute predicts based phone location every day well thats probably work kind stuff think computers get lot better hesitate call full blown ai computers getting better like first ton data everybody smartphone sudden data didnt location communication feeding basic heuristics maybe fancy algorithms turn predictions anticipating needs like friend would right like oh hey see home would like dinner right like lets go get food thats usually time day right context actually act programming see ides improving making life programming better think possible theres lot repetition programming right oh know clippy would bad example oh see looks like youre writing loop patterns code right actually libraries kind like right rather go code http request library like well youd use one existing ones thats already troubleshot right ai per se building better lego bricks bigger lego bricks functionality people dont worry low level stuff much anymore like wordpress example like tool somebody isnt programmer something mean turn wordpress anything kind crazy actually plugins right thats programming per se lego bricks stacking wordpress elements right little bit configuration glue would say maybe broader sense im seeing like therell gluing less actual programming thats good thing right stuff need kind already said 1970s unix see php kind old remnants early birth programming remaining us long time like said unix see ultimately stuff momentum kind mean big believer windows early big know like unix waste time time ive completely flipped like okay unix guys right pretty much microsoft windows kind wrong least server side desktop right need gui need stuff two philosophies like apple built unix effectively darwin desktop slightly different story server side youre gonna programming question programmings gonna theres gonna lot like client side programming technically discourse client side programming way get discourse deliver big ball javascript executed locally really using lot local computing power well still retrieve data obviously display posts screen forth terms like sorting lot basic stuff using host processor extent lot programming still gonna server side would say yeah unix philosophy definitely therell different veneers unix still peel away one two layers gonna unixy long think unix mean definitively interesting hear say youve done much excellent work microsoft side terms backend development cool whats future hold jeff atwood mean discourse continuing discourse trying improve conversation web well discourse ive viewed originally called five year project really quickly revised 10 year project started early 2013 thats launched first version still five years part starts getting good like good product discourse theres project build software takes three years build want build anyway like v1 gonna terrible ship anyway thats get better stuff turning crank v1 perfect thats ridiculous v1 lets get really good v11 12 13 like fast iterate think iterating like crazy discourse point like really good product serious momentum original vision wanna wordpress discussion meaning someone came said wanna start blog although question kind archaic like actually blogs anymore wanted answer would wordpress normally thats obvious choice blogging time someone said hey need group people get together something answer discourse right default answer people open source free doesnt cost anything control run minimum server cost discourse five bucks month point actually got vps prices used 10 month one gigabyte ram kind heavy stack like theres lot stuff discourse need postgres need redis need ruby rails need sidekick scheduling trivial amount stuff architected like look building next 10 years dont care shared php hosting thats model idea like hey eventually gonna cheap everybody wanna build right using higher bigger building block levels right requirements theres wordpress model wordpressorg wordpresscom central hosting discourse strictly segmenting open source versus commercial side hosting business thats discourse makes money host discourse instances really close relationship customers symbiosis giving us feedback product definitely wait feedback customers lot heavier feedback somebody wanders gives feedback thats make money dont strict division encourage people use discourse like whole point free right anybody set dont wanna person hosts discourse thats absolutely goal primary way us build business actually kind great business mean business going really really well terms hosting used work google research company thats basically funded advertisements facebook let ask comment think advertisement best youd extremely critical ads best actually serving sense giving connecting would want explore like related posts related content thats best advertisement discourse connecting people based interests seems like place advertisement best could actually serve users something youre considering thinking way bring financially support platform thats interesting actually contrarian view advertising kind agree recently installed adblocker reluctantly dont like performance ads man theyre heavy crazy almost like performance argument like actually pro ads contrarian viewpoint agree ads right serving stuff would interested anyway dont mind actually kind good thing plus think rational wanna support people work seeing ads said run adblock didnt wanna convinced articles like 30 40 megabytes stuff serve ads yeah feels like ads like experts exchange whenever start stock overflow little bit overwhelming oh theres many companies ad tech embarrassing like seen logo charts like whole page like cant even see theyre small theres many companies space since brought wanna point discourse sites actually run using ad supported model effective like diluted weird doesnt pay well like users hate combination like users hate doesnt actually work well practice like theory yes agree clean fast ads exactly stuff would interested awesome far though right like google okay job retargeting stuff like real world discourse sites rarely make ads work doesnt work many reasons know work subscriptions patreon affiliate codes like amazon like oh heres cool yo yo click click go amazon get small percentage fair think mean saw yo yo site clicked bought right thats fair get 5 2 whatever things definitely work fact site used participate lot helped owner one things got switch discourse basically paid switch discourse like look guys got switch cant come anymore terrible software like look top like youre serving people ads hate like go full patreon little bit patreon go full patreon amazon affiliates thing amazon links get posted triple stuff thats worked really well creator particular stuff works traditional ads mean definitely working least discourse last question youve created code keyboard ive programmed adult life kinesis keyboard one upstairs describe mechanical keyboard something makes happy well know another fetish item really like required programming kind keyboard even like onscreen keyboard oh god thats terrifying could mean look back early days computing chiclet keyboards awful whats chiclet keyboard oh god ok well like thin rubber membranes oh rubber ones oh super bad right fetish item really says look care really keyboards keyboard primary method communication computer like nice mic podcast want nice keyboard right tactile feel tell exactly press key get little click oh feels good also kind fetish item like wow care enough programming care tool primary tool use communicate computer make sure good feels good use productive honest little bit fetish item good one indicates youre serious indicates youre interested indicates care fundamentals know makes good programmer able type really fast right true right core skill able type fast enough get ideas head code base practicing typing make better programmer also something makes well makes enjoy typing correct actual act something process like play piano tactile theres tactile feel ultimately feeds passion makes happy right totally thats mean funny artisanal keyboards exploded like massdrop gone ballistic stuff theres probably like 500 keyboard projects massdrop alone theres guy follow twitter used write site tech report way back day hes like every week hes posting call keyboard porn cool keyboards like oh god look really cool right like many keyboards guy right kind like yo yos many yo yos many need well technically one like lot dont know thing keyboards yeah theyre awesome like highly recommend anybody doesnt mechanical research look see like ultimately fetish item think sort items religious artifacts part make us human like parts important right kind makes life worth living yeah necessary strictest sense aint nothing necessary think right like yeah sure jeff thank much talking today yeah youre welcome thanks mean theyve running long time still extremely rich source information whats broken system trying fix think theres lot power connecting people love stuff around specific topic meaning facebooks idea connection human thats related another human right like friendship reason facebooks idea world sort status update right like friend something ate restaurant right whereas discussion forums traditionally around interest graph like love electric cars specifically love tesla right like love way approach problem love style founder love design ethic theres lot like tesla dont know saw oatmeal whole love comic tesla actually kind cool learned stuff talking great tesla cars specifically like built differently went lot great detail really interesting oatmeal post read genesis pretty much interest communities really love stuff like example theres yo yos right like im yo yo communities interest communities really fascinating feel connected yo yo communities friends dont see often right like powerful thing interest graph facebook kind dabbles interest graph mean groups sign groups stuff really relationship graph like coworker relative friend much interest think thats linchpin forums communities built personally love like said leadership passion right passionate stuff really valid way look world think way lot stuff world gets done like someone describe hes like jeff youre guy get super passionate things time go super deep things like oh thats kind right thats kind get something super couple years whatever learn go super deep thats enjoy experiencing world right like shallow bunch things really deep things im interested forums kind unlock right dont want world everything belongs facebook least dont want world communities kind set norms set rules control experience community also ownership right like youre meeting barnes noble every thursday barnes noble says get guys dont buy enough books well know youre kind hosed right barnes noble owns right like cant meeting space know clubhouse set rules decide want talk really generate lot better information could like hanging barnes noble every thursday 3 pm right thats kind vision discourse place fully open source take software install anywhere know group people go deep whatever youre works startups right startups group people go super deep specific problem right want talk community like well install discourse right thats discourse thats stack overflow spent lot time meta stack overflow internal well public community feedback site experiencing users experiencing right theyre ones work system lot interesting feedback theres 90 10 rule like 90 feedback get really actionable variety reasons might bad feedback might crazy feedback might feedback cant act right theres 10 thats like gold like literally gold diamonds like feedback really good improvements core product super hard get actually make lot sense favorite 5 stuff didnt even see coming like oh god never even thought thats brilliant idea right point many features stack overflow derive meta stack overflow feedback meta discourse right exact principle discourse know getting ideas community like oh god never thought thats fantastic right like love relationship community built communities learned whats process getting critical mass members community luck skill timing persistence tools like discourse empower community whats key aspect starting one guy gal building two 10 hundred thousand think youre starting n one mean think persistence also interesting like somebody really admire said something always liked blogging hes like heres blog something interesting say interesting way saying right like 10 years thats genesis like sort something interesting say thats exactly everybody else saying interesting way saying another way saying kind entertaining way saying far growing like ritual know like like say youre starting blog say look im gonna blog every week three times week stick schedule right like several years youre never gonna get anywhere like takes years get need get part discipline stick schedule helps something youre passionate wont feel like work youre like love could talk day every day right way thats interesting people youre growing community pattern participation within community like generating artifacts inviting people help like collaborate artifacts like even case blogging like felt early days blog started 2004 really genesis stack overflow look blog leads stack overflow energy blog dont like 40000 people subscribing like wanna something met joel said hey joel wanna something take ball energy blog something people reading blog saw like oh cool youre involving us youre saying look youre part community lets build thing together like pick name like voted name stack overflow blog like came naming super hard first hardest problem computer science coming good name stuff right go back blog theres poll voted stack overflow became name site early beta users stack overflow audience blog plus joels blog right started like look genesis okay programmer said hey love programming outlet talk im gonna blog dont enough people work talk time worked place know programming wasnt core output company pharmaceutical company love stuff know absurd degree like ill blog ill find audience eventually found audience eventually found joel eventually built stack overflow one core activity right repetition feeding back feedback blog comments feedback joel feedback early stack overflow community people see youre follow along right theyll say cool youre good faith youre actually know listening everything thats impossible thats impossible youre actually know waiting feedback youre wouldnt work stack overflow joel programmers work gotta respect know discipline around look know trying specific thing stack overflow trying solve worlds problems trying solve specific q problem specific way cause jerks strict set rules help us get really good results right programmers thats easy sell part programmers used dealing ridiculous systems rules like constantly thats basically job theyre oh yeah super strict system rules lets get want thats programming right thats stack overflow youre making sound easy 2004 lets go back 2004 started blog coding horror called beginning one smart things book steve mcconnell code complete one favorite programming books still probably number one programming book anyone read one smart things back dont always smart things start stuff contacted steve said hey really like sidebar illustration indicating danger code right coding horror like watch love illustration spoke saw illustration go oh god thats like im always worst enemy like thats key insight programming every time write something think gonna screw constantly right icon like oh yeah need constantly hold mirror look say look youre fallible youre gonna screw like build way youre gonna screw later like get discipline around making sure every step im thinking things could wrong people could wrong actually get better programmer lot times right sidebar illustration loved much wrote steve started blog said hey permission use really like illustration steve kind enough give permission continues give permission yeah really thats awesome 2004 started blog know look stephen king book writing stephen pressfield war art book mean seems like writers suffer mean hard process writing right theres gonna suffering mean wont kid well work suffering right like work like even youre every week youre like okay blog post wasnt good people didnt like people said disparaging things like attitude like know matter happens wanna right mean end everyone good work gets world pretty strict saying like know im selfish sense know mentioned stephen king like book writing like one things example writing like read loud one best pieces advice writing anything read loud like multiple times make sound like youre talking goal good writing sound like said slightly better phrasing time think youre saying like sound natural say think thats probably single best writing advice give anyone read loud make sure sounds like something would normally say sounds good whats process writing see theres usually pretty good idea behind blog post ideas right think gotta concept theres many interesting things world like mean god world amazing right like never write everything thats going incredible cant come like lets say one interesting thing per day talk youre trying hard enough world full super interesting stuff one great way like mine stuff go back old books cause bring old stuff thats still super relevant lot cause like reading classic programming books lot early blog posts like oh reading programming book brought really cool concept wanna talk get mean youre claiming credit idea gives something interesting talk thats kind evergreen right like dont go talk well go dig old classic programming books find something oh wow thats interesting apply today x compare two concepts pull couple sentences book sort play almost agree disagree 2007 wrote offered significant amount money sell blog chose elements thinking cause id like take back seems like theres lot nonlinear decisions made life decision like right one things love choose adventure books loved kid feel like theyre early programmer books cause theyre statements right theyre also unforgiving like theres sites map classic choose adventure books many outcomes bad lot bad outcomes part game like oh got bad outcome go back one step go back one step like get right like sequence decisions true life right like every decision sequence right individually individual decision necessarily right wrong lead path right think theres truth particular decision blog gotten fairly popular theres lot rss readers discovered guy contacted blue like bug tracking company hes like oh really wanna buy blog like think around 100000 might like 80000 lot right like thats know time like would years worth salary didnt really think like well know remember talking people time like wow thats lot money im like really like blog right like wanna sell blog cause wouldnt really belong anymore point one guidelines like dont like give advice people lot one pieces advice give cause think really true generally helpful whenever youre looking set decisions like oh gosh b c gotta pick thing thats little scarier list know like jump cliff scary thing makes nervous cause pick safe choice usually youre really pushing youre pushing youre choosing thing thats gonna help grow scarier choice say like well lets see going right mean belongs thing take tell logical conclusion right imagine different world would said yes sold blog like probably wouldnt stack overflow know lot stuff would changed particular decision think rule like scares little bit thing scares yeah speaking startups think theres specific general questions lot people would interested youve started stack overflow started course whats one two three guys whatever beginning process like start talking start programming start like wheres birth catalyst actually well talk context stack overflow discourse think key thing initially problem something theres state world thats unsatisfactory point like youre upset right like case experts exchange mean joels original idea approached joel like look joel energy behind blog want something want build something dont know im honestly good idea person im really im like execution guy im really good execution im good like blue skying ideas forte another reason like community feedback blue sky day long right go cherry pick blue sky idea community even spend three hours reading get one good idea worth man anyway idea joel hey experts exchange got great data experience hideous right trying trick feels like used car salesman bad like oh thats awesome feeds community feeds like know make creative comments think core really good idea feel strongly beginning like theres wrong world injustice write process building thing discourse like look theres good software communities hang like stuff right like whether problem solving startup whatever forums great building block online community theyre hideous bad right embarrassing like literally embarrassed associated software right like software proud like competitive reddit competitive twitter competitive facebook right would proud software site genesis discourse feeling strongly needs good solution communities thats step one genesis idea feel super strongly right people galvanize around idea like joel already super excited idea excited idea forum software posting twitter researched part research start researching problem right found game called forum wars parody forum still funny forum behavior circa would say 2003 aged right like behaviors little different twitter awesome funny like game like rpg forum attached like game forums forum attached like awesome right cool founder company project wasnt really company contacted guy robin ward toronto said hey saw youve talking forums really love problem space like id still love build really good forum software dont think anything theres good like awesome point like starting company couldnt whooshed better person walk door say im excited thing joel right mean joel legend industry right walked said im excited problem like man right important step like idea youre super excited another person cofounder right get dual leadership right making bad decision sometimes nice checks like good idea dont know right crucial seeds starting build stuff whether programming somebody elses prototyping theres tons research theres tons research like whats failed lot people look successes oh look successful x everybody looks successes boring show failures whats interesting thats people experimenting thats people pushing failed probably failed reasons werent directly quality idea right look failures dont look everybody looks like oh gosh look successful people look failures look things didnt work research entire field thats research led robin right example stack overflow like okay well really like elements voting dig read like wikipedia everythings date nothing like old tombstone horrible date information know works wikipedia amazing resource blogging idea ownership powerful right like oh joe wrote look good joes answer right concepts rolling together researching things working working trying fold frankensteins monster stack overflow way wasnt free decision theres still ton tension stack overflow system theres reasons people complain stack overflow strict right strict guys always closing questions theres much tension built system around trying get good good results system free stuff doesnt come free right like perfect answers nobody get feelings heard nobody get downvoted doesnt work way right interesting point small tangent write anxiety ive posted lot questions written answers stack overflow question side usually go something specific something im working something talk really goal stack overflow isnt write question thats question help community future right thats tough sell right people like well dont really care community care problem thats fair right sort tension balancing act wanna help also wanna help everybody comes behind long line people gonna come say oh kinda problem right nobodys ever gonna come say problem question shouldnt exist stack overflow question specific even thats tension right judge know nobodys ever gonna particular question theres lot tension system think anxiety asking question anxiety answering tension inherent programmers inherent kind process improved happy land tension quite harsh dont think stack overflow totally change way works one thing working finally ask page changed since 2011 im still kind bitter feel like qa system core pages qa system well first question answers also ask page particularly youre new user someone trying ask question thats point need help didnt adapt times good news theyre working understand gonna wizard based format could envision world part wizard based program youre asking questions okay come good title good words put title one word thats good put title problem example problem oh problem okay problem thats great need specifics trying help make good question title example step broken stuff one steps wizard asking could say hey im little nervous ive never done put queue special mentoring could opt special mentor think would fantastic dont objection terms opt system people like wanna help wanna help person matter wanna go beyond wanna spend hours person depends goals great idea judge thats fine precluded happening theres certain big city ethos started like look new york city dont come new york city expect oh welcome city joe hows going come let show around thats new york city works new york city reputation rude actually dont think fairly recently rude like going business like look things im busy im busy professional since youre busy professional certainly ask question youre gonna ask best possible question youre busy professional would accept anything less well written question lot detail youre youre researched found youre professional like rubs people sometimes wrong way dont think wrong say look dont want experience want chill place beginners still think stack overflow never designed beginners right theres misconception even joel says sometimes oh yeah stack overflow beginners think youre prodigy right part thats really representative right like think beginner want totally different set tools want like live screen sharing live chat want access resources want playground like playground experiment like test stuff dont give people never really audience designing stack overflow doesnt mean wrong think would awesome site like internet stack overflow said hey know gonna start thats fine know im im making decisions think pressure tension described people look im little nervous know gotta best work right one something talk also really interesting duplicate questions really difficult problem highlight super hard like could take one little topic could probably write 10 20 30 ways asking topic different dont know one page answers way stack overflow help disambiguate like separate duplicate questions connect together totally hopeless difficult impossible task think hard computer science problem partly people good using completely different words always amazed stack overflow youd two questions functionally identical one question like zero words common question like oh god computer science perspective even begin solve happens time people super good right accidentally asking thing like 10 20 different ways complexity want duplicates exist theres five versions different words five versions point one centralized answer right like okay duplicate worries heres answer wanted prime example want rather 10 copies question answer 10 copies question answer also devalues reputation system programmers hate previously mentioned youre getting reputation answer somebody else already gave like well answer somebody else already gave answer getting reputation answer guy gave four years ago people get offended right reputation system adds tension system people lot reputation become incentivized enforce reputation system part thats good know sounds weird parts like look strict systems think use stack overflow idea ok strict systems ultimately work better think programming youre familiar loose typing versus strict typing right idea declare variable declare variable rather start using variable ok see implicitly integer bam awesome duck equals 5 well duck integer 5 right youre like cool awesome simpler right would want worry typing long time ruby community theyre like yeah awesome bunch unit testing testing programs validity fact catch bugs strict typing variables would caught thing called typescript microsoft guy built c sharp anders whos one greatest minds software development right like terms language design says want bolt strict type system javascript makes things better everybodys like oh god deployed typescript found 50 latent bugs didnt know right like super common think truth programming strictness goal saying super strict strictness correct strictness produces better results thats im saying right strict typing variables would say almost universally consensus basically correct way every language right duck equals five generate error didnt declare didnt tell duck integer right thats bug right maybe mistyped typed deck instead duck right never know happens time right mind say strictness system correct doesnt mean cruel doesnt mean mean doesnt mean angry means strict ok think theres misunderstanding people get cranky right like another question asked like programmers kind mean sometimes well programmers work day long theory youre job work assholes day long eventually become asshole asshole computer except worlds biggest asshole computer time bullshit computer minute make mistake everything crashing right one semicolon crashed space missions right thats normal begin internalize begin think oh coworker computer super strict kind jerk everything thats kind im going work computer exceed terms everything therefore start absorb start think oh well really strict arbitrarily really good error error code 56249 completely good error message thats computer gave right kind forget person level know say great detectives internalize criminals kind criminals like trope master detective good think like criminal well think thats true programmers really good programmers think like computer thats job internalize much become computer kind become jerk everybody thats youve internalized youre almost jerk patience lack strictness said sense meanness accidental believe occupational hazard programmer start behave like computer youre unforgiving youre terse youre oh wrong incorrect move like well help could fix wrong next question like thats normal computer fail next dont know remember saturday night live 90s character guy move guy move move jimmy fallon played ok yeah remember move right patience might mad tv actually wasnt mad tv might anyway thats always perception start behave like computer like oh youre wrong way know youve written many blog posts programming programs programming programmers think makes good lets start makes good solo programmer well dont think solo programmer think good solo programmer kind like talked well mike one things john carmack one best points makes book masters doom fantastic book anybody listening hasnt read please read great book time working stuff like wolfenstein doom didnt resources today didnt stack overflow didnt wikipedia didnt discourse forums didnt places go get people help work thats took genius like carmack stuff genius invent first principles lot stuff like hacks coming genius genius level stuff dont need genius anymore means working good researching stuff online good asking questions really good questions really well researched implies oh went researched three hours wrote questions thats thats whats going make good big difference programming 80s versus programming today kind back would go answers remember early days learning visual basic windows would call microsoft helpline phone programming like dont know would go call huge phone banks im like imagine alien would thats crazy nowhere else go got stuck books came read studied religiously saw post steve sanofsky said c version 7 came 10000 pages written material else going figure stuff go library mean didnt wikipedia didnt reddit didnt anywhere go answer questions youve talked years basically ego thinking youre best programmer world always kind looking improve become better programmer yesterday changed programmer thinker designer around programming past 15 years really public figure would say big insight eventually programmer stop writing code effective kind disturbing really love realize effective programming programming general sense doesnt mean writing code lot times much successful writing code writing code terms solving problems essentially hiring people really good setting free giving basic direction strategy stuff lot problems encounter arent necessarily solved really gnarly code theyre solved conceptual solutions turned code even solving right problem would say main insight succeed programmer eventually kind stop writing code thats going sound discouraging probably people hearing dont mean way mean youre coding higher level language eventually like ok coding assembly language thats beginning right youre hardcoded architecture stuff like c like wow abstract across architecture write code compile code arm whatever x86 whatever else even higher level youre looking python ruby interpreted languages programmer im like ok want go even higher want go higher abstract higher language like well abstract spoken language written language right youre sort inspiring people get things done giving guidance like youre writing highest level language english whatever spoken language effective right think patrick mckenzie patio11 hacker news works stripe great post calling programmer career limiting move level get far enough career really believe apologize sound discouraging dont mean hes right stuff goes around code like people thats another thing look early blog entries wow programming people code doesnt really make sense people even get along together understand even explain youre working solving right problem peopleware another classic programming book code complete please read peopleware software people people software first foremost lot skills working early blog figuring people parts programming harder parts hard part programming get certain skill level programming pretty much solve reasonable problem thats put front youre writing algorithms scratch doesnt happen sort reasonable problem put front youre going able solve cant solve manager total jerk cannot solve code code solvable problem yet cripple way oh use stupid framework dont like sam keeps writing bad code hate dave wilderness writing god knows problems problem manager co worker toxic everybody else team nobody get anything done everybodys stressed freaked problems attack absolutely go higher level abstractions youve developed programmer higher higher level abstractions go natural language youre also guy preached building diving learn yes worry get higher higher level abstractions lose track lower level building worry even maybe 10 years 20 years well mean always paranoia around oh gosh dont feel valuable since im writing code started discourse project ruby didnt really know ruby mean pointed another valuable observation stack overflow super proficient example c sharp working thats built stack overflow still written switch ruby youre newbie framework know loop know recursion know stack trace fundamental concepts programmer dont know ruby im still higher level im like beginner beginner like youre saying im like need apply programming concepts already know ruby well theres question thats really interesting looking ruby go learning enough intuition applied carried thats trying get like realized particularly started robin realized bother robin costing us productivity every time go robin rather building first alpha version discourse hes answering stupid questions ruby good use time good use time answer resoundingly getting alpha pretty much ok well hire programmers eventually hired neil eventually sam came cofounder actually sam first neil later answer problem hire competent programmers shall pull bootstraps learn ruby point writing code becomes liability terms getting things done theres many things go project like building prototype mentioned well youre writing code everybody keep focus building well first basic mockups research even want build theres little bit goes quickly get prototype stage like build prototype lets iterate prototype really really rapidly thats discourse thats demoed get seed funding discourse alpha version discourse running ready go bad mean ill tell bad screenshots im embarrassed look prototype figuring whats working whats working theres broad gap way think things work mind even paper way work sit live software like actually spend time living breathing software different philosophy get prototype youre really optimizing speed iteration like turn crank quickly iterate thats absolutely critical metric software project tweet recently people liked totally fundamental like want measure core competency software tech company speed somebody say hey really need word product change word right clear user like instead respond reply something theres conception idea quickly single word changed software rolled users life cycle thats health heartbeat heartbeat like super slow youre basically dead seriously like takes two weeks even month get single word changed everybodys like oh god great idea word much clearer im talking like super like everybodys board change like lets change word bored like awesome change takes months roll like well youre dead cant iterate cant going anything right anyway heartbeat like get prototype iterate thats view central tenet modern software development thats fascinating put way work build autonomous vehicles look maybe compare tesla automakers heart beat tesla literally days terms air deploy software updates vehicles markedly different every automaker takes years update piece software thats reflected everything thats final product thats reflected really slowly adapt times clear im saying hummingbird goal

       " 'following conversation eric schmidt ceo google 10 years chairman six guiding company incredible period growth series world changing innovations one impactful leaders era internet powerful voice promise technology society truly honor speak part mit course artificial general intelligence artificial intelligence podcast heres conversation eric schmidt first moment fell love technology grew 1960s boy every boy wanted astronaut part space program like everyone else age would go cow pasture behind house literally cow pasture would shoot model rockets think beginning course generationally today would video games amazing things online computers theres transformative inspiring aspect science math maybe rockets would bring would instill individuals youve mentioned yesterday eighth grade math journey mathematical universe diverges many people fork roadway theres professor math berkeley edward frankel im sure youre familiar written amazing book recommend everybody called love math two favorite words says painting taught like math students would asked paint fence analogy essentially math taught never get chance discover beauty art painting beauty art math discover beauty think happens people like math enabled pretty early sudden discover use discover new insights great scientists tell story men women fantastic today somewhere high school college discovered could discover something sense building something impact drives knowledge acquisition learning case programming notion could build things existed built name open source could think open source contributions today 16 17 year old boy im sure would aspire computer scientist make contribution like open source heroes world today would would driving id trying learning making mistakes forth ways works repository github represents open source libraries represent enormous bank knowledge people one lessons learned google world big place theres awful lot smart people awful lot underutilized heres opportunity example building parts programs building new ideas contribute greater society moment 70s inspiring moment nothing created something programming magical moment 1975 think youve created program called lex especially like name lex thank thank creating brand established reputation thats long lasting reliable big impact world still used today thank seriously time 70s engineer personal computers born think youd able predict 80s 90s aughts computers would go im sure could would gotten right beneficiary great work many many people saw clearer lex worked fellow named michael lesk

drive hour berkeley go use made point skipping classes whatever took access extraordinary achievement knew consequential understand scaling understand would happen 100 million opposed 100 since learned benefit scale always look things going scale platforms right mobile phones android things world numerous many many people world people really needs really use platforms build big businesses top interesting see piece technology think technology look like hands billion people thats right example would market competitive cant figure way something million users billion users probably going

relatively technical people understood scale impact used ncp predecessor tcpip made sense connect things didnt think terms internet companies facebook twitter politics forth never build didnt vision think people rare person see compounding scale people see ask people predict future theyll give answer six nine months 12 months thats far people imagine theres old saying actually attributed professor mit long time ago overestimate done one year underestimate done decade theres great deal evidence core platforms hardware software take decade right think self driving cars self driving cars thought 90s projects around first darpa grand challenge roughly 2004 thats roughly 15 years ago today self driving cars operating city arizona right 15 years still ways go theyre generally available youve spoken importance talked predicting future youve spoken importance thinking five years ahead plan five years way say almost everybody one year plan almost one proper five year plan key thing five year plan model whats going happen underlying platforms heres example moores law know thing powered improvements cpus largely halted traditional shrinking mechanism costs gotten high getting harder harder theres plenty algorithmic improvements specialized hardware improvements need understand nature improvements theyll go order understand change platform area network connectivity gains gonna possible wireless looks like theres enormous expansion wireless connectivity many different bands primarily historically ive always thought primarily gonna using fiber looks like gonna using fiber plus powerful high bandwidth sort short distance connectivity bridge last mile thats amazing achievement know youre gonna build systems differently way networks different latency properties right theyre symmetric algorithms feel faster reason think whether fiber technologies general theres barber wooden poem quote really like champions impossible rather slaves possible evolution draws

people moving cities make livable safe first youve also worked greatest leaders history tech insights draw difference leadership styles steve jobs elon musk larry page new ceo sandra pichai others would say calm sages mad geniuses one things learned young executive theres single formula leadership try teach one thats really works people understand need need quickly people often entrepreneurs know move fast people systems thinkers planners thats somewhat conservative thorough execution little bit risk risk little bit risk averse theres also people sort slightly insane sense emphatic charismatic feel drive forth theres single formula success one thing unifies people named high intelligence end day thing characterizes saw world quicker faster processed information faster didnt necessarily make right decisions time top thing thats interesting people started young think steve jobs starting apple roughly 18 19 think bill gates starting roughly 20 21 think time 30 mark zuckerberg good example 19 20 time 30 10 years 30 years old 10 years experience dealing people products shipments press business forth incredible much experience compared rest us busy getting phds yes exactly celebrate people theyve life experience right helps inform judgment end day youre top organizations easy questions dealt right design buildings put colors product box look like right problems thats interesting rooms problems face right terms way operate way deal employees customers innovation profoundly challenging companies demonstrably different culturally fact cut behave differently based input internal cultures different compensation schemes different values different theres proof diversity works faced tough decision need advice said best thing one find best person world give advice find way room one one ask let ask long winded way wrote 1998 many good search engines lycos excite altavista infoseek ask jeeves maybe yahoo even google stepped disrupted everything disrupted nature search nature access information way discover new knowledge 2018 actually 20 years later many good personal ai assistants including course best google youve spoken medical education impact ai assistant could bring arrive question personal one hope situation represents many said dreamers crazy engineers whole life ive dreamed creating ai assistant every step ive taken towards goal im research scientist human centered ai mit next step sit facing passion larry sergey 98 simple startup heres simple question given low odds success timing luck required countless factors cant controlled predicted things larry sergey faced calculation strategy follow step simply follow passion theres choice think people universities always trying study extraordinarily chaotic nature innovation entrepreneurship answer didnt conversation sensed moment case google data needed organized better algorithm invented better way today human centered ai area research must new approaches big field must new approaches different others must startups fund must research projects try must graduate students work new approaches mit people looking learning standpoint looking child learning children learn starting age one two work fantastic approaches different approach people taking perhaps thats bet make perhaps theres another one end day successful entrepreneurs crazy sound see opportunity based whats happened lets use uber example travis sells story co founder sitting paris idea couldnt get cab said smartphones rest history whats equivalent travis eiffel tower cab moment could entrepreneur take advantage whether human centered ai something else thats next great startup psychology moment sergey larry talk listen interviews nonchalant well heres fascinating web data heres algorithm kind want play around data seems like thats really nice way organize data say happened remember graduate students stanford thought interesting built search engine kept room get power room next door using much power room ran extension cord right went found house google world headquarters five people right start company raised 100000 andy bechtolsheim sun founder dave cheriton others point beginnings simple based powerful insight replicable model startup powerful insight beginnings simple innovation larry sergeys case pagerank brilliant idea one cited papers world today whats next one youre one may say richest people world yet seems money simply side effect passions inherent goal youre fascinating person ask much society individual level company level nations driven desire wealth think drive learned may romanticize notion meaning life achieved success many dimensions many studies human happiness threshold typically relatively low conversation theres difference happiness money happiness correlated meaning purpose sense family sense impact organize life assuming enough get around nice home forth youll far happier figure care work often service others theres great deal evidence people happiest theyre serving others goes directly sort press induced excitement powerful wealthy leaders one kind indeed consequential people situation youve fortunate also take responsibility basically work educate others give opportunity also use wealth advance human society case im particularly interested using tools artificial intelligence machine learning make society better ive mentioned

honor conversation part mit course artificial general intelligence artificial intelligence podcast enjoy please subscribe youtube itunes podcast provider choice simply connect twitter lex friedman spelled f r heres conversation stuart russell youve mentioned 1975 high school youve created one first ai programs play chess ever able build program beat chess another board game program never beat chess actually wrote program imperial college used take bus every wednesday box cards big shove card reader gave us eight seconds cpu time took five seconds read cards compile code three seconds cpu time enough make one move know deep search would print move wed go back queue wait feed cards deep search talking one move two moves three moves think got eight move depth eight alpha beta tricks move ordering pruning tree still able beat program yeah yeah reasonable chess player youth othello program backgammon program got berkeley worked lot call meta reasoning really means reasoning reasoning case game playing program need reason parts search tree youre actually going explore search tree enormous bigger number atoms universe way programs succeed way humans succeed looking small fraction search tree look right fraction play really well look wrong fraction waste time thinking things never going happen moves ones ever going make youre going lose wont able figure right decision question machines manage computation decide think meta reasoning question developed methods simply machine think whatever thoughts going improve decision quality able show othello standard two player game backgammon includes dice rolls two player game uncertainty cases could come algorithms actually much efficient standard alpha beta search chess programs time using programs could beat think see basic ideas alpha go alpha zero today way explore tree using form meta reasoning select think based useful think insights describe greek symbols select paths go theres really two kinds learning going say alpha go learns evaluate board positions look go board actually probably superhuman ability instantly tell promising situation amazing thing alpha go world champion hands tied behind back fact stop searching altogether say okay youre allowed thinking ahead consider legal moves look resulting situation evaluate call depth one search immediate outcome moves decide thats good bad version alpha go still play professional level human professionals sitting five 10 minutes deciding alpha go less second instantly intuit right move make based ability evaluate positions remarkable dont level intuition go actually think situation anyway capability alpha go one big part beats humans big part able look ahead 40 50 60 moves future considering possibilities 40 50 60 moves future would 10 200 possibilities way atoms universe selective looks let try give intuition decide think combination two things one promising youre already convinced move terrible theres point spending lot time convincing terrible probably going change mind real reason think theres possibility changing mind changing mind would result better final action real world thats purpose thinking improve final action real world think move guaranteed terrible convince terrible youre still going change mind hand suppose choice two moves one youve already figured guaranteed draw lets say one looks little bit worse looks fairly likely make move youre going lose theres still uncertainty value move theres still possibility turn win worth thinking even though less promising average move good move worth thinking average move guaranteed draw theres still purpose thinking theres chance change mind discover fact better move combination good move appears much uncertainty value uncertainty worth thinking theres higher upside want think way course beginning especially alphago zero formulation everything shrouded uncertainty youre really swimming sea uncertainty benefits mean actually following process described youre uncertain everything basically try lot different directions yeah early parts search tree fairly bushy look lot different possibilities fairly quickly degree certainty moves mean move really terrible youll pretty quickly find right lose half pieces half territory youll say okay worth thinking anymore tree becomes long narrow youre following various lines play 10 20 30 40 50 moves future something human beings hard time mainly lack short term memory cant remember sequence moves thats 50 moves long cant imagine board correctly many moves future course top players im much familiar chess top players probably echoes kind intuition instinct moments time alphago applies see board mean theyve seen patterns human beings seen patterns top grandmaster level seems similarities maybe imagination creates vision similarities feels like kind pattern recognition alphago approaches using similar human beings top level using think theres theres truth entirely yeah mean think extent human grandmaster reliably instantly recognize right move instantly recognize value position think thats little bit overrated sacrifice queen example mean theres theres beautiful games chess bobby fischer somebody seeming make bad move im sure theres perfect degree calculation involved theyve calculated possible things happen theres instinct right somehow adds yeah think happens get sense theres possibility position even make weird looking move opens lines calculation otherwise would definitely bad intuition theres something position might might yield win follow right sense chess player following line mind theyre theyre mentally simulating person going opponent going long moves kind forced right long theres know theres fort call forcing variation opponent doesnt really much choice respond follow respond see force situation win know see plenty mistakes even even grandmaster games miss simple three four five move combination know wasnt particularly apparent position still thats thing makes us human yeah mentioned othello games matter reasoning improvements research able beat make feel part meta reasoning capability based learning could sit next day could feel got lot smarter know sudden really felt like youre sort pressed wall much aggressive totally unforgiving minor mistake might make actually seemed understood game better gary kasparov quote match deep blue said suddenly felt new kind intelligence across board think thats scary exciting possibility kasparov context chess purely sort like feeling whatever think definitely exciting feeling know made work ai first place soon really understood computer wanted make smart know started first program wrote sinclair programmable calculator think could write 21 step algorithm biggest program could write something like little arithmetic calculations think implemented newtons method square roots things like know thought okay space could make thing intelligent started thinking ai think thing thats scary chess program know chess programs theyre taking world business extrapolate know things chess dont resemble real world right know know rules chess chess board completely visible program course real world real world visible wherever youre sitting speak overcome kinds problems need qualitatively different algorithms another thing real world know regularly plan ahead timescales involving billions trillions steps dont plan detail know choose phd berkeley thats five year commitment amounts trillion motor control steps eventually committed including going stairs opening doors drinking water yeah mean every every finger movement youre typing every character every paper thesis everything youre committing advance specific motor control steps youre still reasoning timescale eventually reduce trillions motor control actions reasons know alphago deep blue dont represent kind threat humanity step towards right progress ai occurs essentially removing one one assumptions make problems easy like assumption complete observability situation right remove assumption need much complicated kind computing design needs needs something actually keeps track things cant see tries estimate whats going theres inevitable uncertainty becomes much complicated problem know removing assumptions starting algorithms cope much longer timescales cope uncertainty cope partial observability steps sort magnifies thousand range things ai systems way started ai wanted psychiatrist long time wanted understand mind high school course program showed university illinois ai lab said okay dont time heres book ai modern approach think first edition time go go go learn remember lay land well incredible solved chess well never solve go mean pretty certain go way thought systems reason wasnt possible solve weve solved well think would said unlikely could take kind algorithm used chess get scale work well go time thought order solve go would something similar way humans manage complexity go break kind sub games human thinks go board think different parts board sort weakly connected think okay within part board heres things could go part board heres things could go try sort couple two analyses together deal interactions maybe revise views things going go part youve got maybe five six seven ten parts board actually resembles real world much chess real world work home life sport different kinds activities shopping connected theyre weakly connected im typing paper dont simultaneously decide order im going get milk butter doesnt affect typing need realize okay better finish shops close dont anything dont food home theres weak connection way chess works everything tied single stream thought thought solve go wed make progress stuff would useful real world way alphago little bit disappointing right program designed alphago actually different deep blue even arthur samuels checker playing program 1950s fact two things make alphago work one amazing ability evaluate positions meta reasoning capability allows explore paths tree deeply abandon paths quickly including youre camera voice coming high resolution yeah could take im saying replace pretty much anything else wanted saying simple thing take im saying replace pretty much anything else wanted saying even would change lips facial expressions fit theres actually much way real legal protection think commercial area could say yeah youre using brand rules political sphere think moment anything goes could really really damaging let try make argument try look back history say something dark essence regulation seems oversight seems exactly right thing seems human beings naturally wait something go wrong youre talking nuclear weapons cant talk nuclear weapons dangerous somebody actually like united states drops bomb chernobyl melting think wait things going wrong way thats obviously damaging society existential risk obviously damaging faith hope think look history two examples gave nuclear weapons nuclear power interesting nuclear weapons knew early years 20th century atoms contained huge amount energy e equals mc squared knew mass differences different atoms components knew might able make incredibly powerful explosive hg wells wrote science fiction book think 1912 frederick soddy guy discovered isotopes nobel prize winner gave speech 1915 saying one pound new explosive would equivalent 150 tons dynamite turns right world war imagining much worse world war would using kind explosive physics establishment simply refused believe things could made including people making well nuclear physics mean eventually ones made talk fermi whoever well development mostly theoretical people using sort primitive kinds particle acceleration experiments level single particles collections particles werent yet thinking actually make bomb anything like knew energy figured understood better might possible physics establishment view think want true view could true could provide way make super weapon famous speech given rutherford sort leader nuclear physics september 11th 1933 said anyone talks possibility obtaining energy transformation atoms talking complete moonshine next morning leo szilard read speech invented nuclear chain reaction soon invented soon idea could make chain reaction neutrons neutrons repelled nucleus could enter nucleus continue reaction soon idea instantly realized world deep doo doo 1933 right hitler recently come power germany szilard london eventually became refugee came us process idea chain reaction figured basically make bomb also make reactor patented reactor 1934 situation great power conflict situation could see happening kept secret beginning world war ii people working including germans actually create neutron sources specific fission reactions would produce neutrons right energy continue reaction demonstrated germany think 1938 remember correctly first nuclear weapon patent 1939 french actually going well world war ii really got going british probably advanced capability area safety reasons among others resources moved program britain us became manhattan project reason couldnt kind oversight nuclear weapons nuclear technology basically already arms race war lr mentioned 20s 30s echoes way youve described story mean theres clearly echoes think ai researchers folks really close metal really concerned ai dont think whether dont want think think echoes nuclear situation current ai situation bf think kind motivated cognition term psychology means believe would like true rather true unsettling think youre working might end human race obviously would rather instantly deny come reason couldnt true collected long list reasons extremely intelligent competent ai scientists come shouldnt worry example calculators superhuman arithmetic havent taken world theres nothing worry well okay five year old know could figured unreasonable really quite weak argument another one theoretically possible could superhuman ai destroy world also theoretically possible black hole could materialize right next earth destroy humanity mean yes theoretically possible quantum theoretically extremely unlikely would materialize right thats completely bogus analogy know whole physics community earth working materialize black hole near earth orbit right wouldnt ask good idea going safe know succeed right thats thing right ai community sort refused ask succeed initially think hard know alan turing asked said wed toast right lucky might able switch power probably wed toast theres also aspect exactly sure future holds clear exactly technically worry sort things go wrong something feels like maybe correct im wrong theres something paralyzing worrying something logically inevitable think logically inevitable dont really know look like yeah think thats reasonable point know certainly terms existential risks different know asteroid collides earth right quite possible know happened past itll probably happen dont know right detect asteroid going hit earth 75 years time wed certainly something well clear theres got big rock theres well probably meeting see big rock ai right ai mean people think going happen within next 75 years know rod brooks doesnt think going happen maybe andrew ng doesnt think happened know lot people work day day know say rock face think going happen think median estimate ai researchers somewhere 40 50 years maybe know think asia think going even faster im little bit conservative think itd probably take longer think know happened nuclear weapons happen overnight breakthroughs need one breakthrough know order half dozen mean rough scale sort half dozen breakthroughs nature would happen us reach superhuman ai know ai research community vast massive investments governments corporations tons really really smart people know look rate progress different areas ai see things moving pretty fast say oh going thousands years dont see basis know see know example stanford 100 year ai project right supposed sort know serious establishment view recent report actually said probably even possible oh wow right want perfect example people denial thats know whole history ai weve saying philosophers said wasnt possible well idea youre talking course possible right give argument couldnt happen isnt one right people worried maybe ai might get bad name dont want think theyre saying okay well course really possible know imagine know leaders cancer biology community got said well know course curing cancer really possible thered complete outrage dismay know find really strange phenomenon okay accept possible accept probably going happen point youre making know go wrong valid question without without answer question youre stuck call gorilla problem know problem gorillas face right made something intelligent namely us million years ago theyre deep doo doo theres really nothing theyve lost control failed solve control problem controlling humans theyve lost dont want situation gorilla problem formulation theres lot right say okay try stop know make humans case make ai think thats really hard im actually proposing thats feasible course action also think know properly controlled ai could incredibly beneficial seems theres consensus one major failure modes loss control create ai systems pursuing incorrect objectives ai system believes knows objective incentive listen us anymore speak right carrying strategy computed optimal solution know may process needs acquire resources increase possibility success prevent various failure modes defending interference collection problems think something address problems roughly speaking know misuse right even solve control problem make perfectly safe controllable ai systems well know dr evil going use right wants take world hell make unsafe ai systems get control thats one problem sort know partly policing problem partly sort cultural problem profession teach people kinds ai systems safe talk autonomous weapon system pretty much everybody agrees theres many ways go horribly wrong great slaughterbots movie kind illustrates beautifully want talk thats another theres another topic im talk want mention see third major failure mode overuse much misuse overuse ai become overly dependent call wall e problem youve seen wall e movie right humans spaceship machines look everything watch tv drink big gulps theyre sort obese stupid sort totally lost notion human autonomy know effect right would happen like slow boiling frog right would gradually turn management civilization machines already know process continues know sort gradually switch sort masters technology guests right become guests cruise ship know fine week rest eternity know almost irreversible right lose incentive example know learn engineer doctor sanitation operative infinitely many ways maintain propagate civilization know dont incentive wont really hard recover course one technologies could third failure mode result theres probably technology general detaches us bit difference terms knowledge run civilization know weve alternative put peoples heads right software google mean software general computers general know knowledge know sanitation system works know thats ai understand good putting google mean weve always put knowledge paper paper doesnt run civilization runs goes paper peoples heads right weve always propagated civilization human minds weve spent trillion person years literally write work right theres 100 billion people whove ever lived spent 10 years learning stuff keep civilization going thats trillion person years put effort beautiful way describe civilization know danger throwing away problem ai cant solve technical problem know job right ai systems say know human race doesnt long run want passengers cruise ship human race wants autonomy part human preferences ai systems going stuff youve got right im going carry top everest autonomous helicopter climb want get benefit im afraid short sighted lazy going override ai systems theres amazing short story recommend everyone talked called machine stops written 1909 em forster know wrote novels british empire sort things became costume dramas bbc wrote one science fiction story amazing vision future basically ipads video conferencing moocs computer induced obesity mean literally people spend time giving online courses listening online courses talking ideas never get real world dont really lot face face contact everything done online know things worrying described story human race becomes dependent machine loses knowledge things really run becomes vulnerable collapse pretty unbelievably amazing story someone writing 1909 imagine theres people represent artificial intelligence stuart russell say okay thats kind fault right youre often brought person well stuart russell like ai person worried thats worried feel burden dont know feel talk people like talk people outside computer science think stuart russell worried ai safety worried feel burden mean practical sense yeah get know dozen sometimes 25 invitations day talk give interviews write press articles practical sense im seeing people concerned really interested worried could wrong good scientists course worry time mean thats thats always way ive worked know like argument head right idea think okay could wrong someone else already idea ill go know search much literature see whether someone else already thought even refuted know right im im reading lot philosophy know form debates utilitarianism kinds moral moral formulas shall say people already thought issues know one things im im seeing lot debates specific idea importance uncertainty objective way think machines beneficial humans idea provably beneficial machines based explicit uncertainty objective know seems know gut feeling core going elaborated lot different directions lot beneficial yeah mean right cant afford know hand wavy beneficial know whenever hand wavy stuff loopholes thing super intelligent machines find loopholes know like know tax evaders dont write tax law properly people find loopholes end paying tax think way getting definitions right know really long process know define mathematical frameworks within framework prove mathematical theorems yes know theoretical entity provably beneficial theoretical entity framework may match real world crucial way long process thinking iterating last question yep 10 seconds answer favorite sci fi movie ai would say interstellar favorite robots oh beats space yeah yeah yeah tars robots one robots interstellar way robot behave uh would say ex machina ways one one makes think uh nervous kind way going well stuart thank much talking today pleasure word meta reasoning technically correct inspires perhaps wrong degree power alphago example word reasoning powerful word let ask sort part symbolic ai world like ai theres lot excellent interesting ideas unfortunately met winter think reemerges would say yeah quite simple ai winter first winter actually named one late 80s came mid 80s really concerted attempt push ai real world using called expert system technology part technology ready primetime trying many cases form uncertain reasoning judgment combinations evidence diagnosis kinds things simply invalid try apply invalid reasoning methods real problems fudge small versions problem starts get larger thing falls apart many companies found stuff didnt work spending tons money consultants try make work practical reasons like asking companies buy incredibly expensive lisp machine workstations literally 50000 100000 1980s money would like 150000 300000 per workstation current prices bottom line werent seeing profit yeah many cases think successes theres doubt people would say overinvested every major company starting ai department like worry bit might see similar disappointments current technology invalid limited scope almost duel scope problems expert systems learned hype cycle prevent another winter example yeah im giving talks days thats one warnings give two part warning slide one rather data new oil data new snake oil thats good line might see kind visible failure major application areas think self driving cars would flagship think look history first self driving car freeway driving changing lanes overtaking 1987 30 years kind looks like today right know prototypes freeway changing lanes overtaking think thats one things thats made particularly perception side worked lot autonomous vehicles early mid 90s berkeley big demonstrations put congressmen self driving cars zooming along freeway problem clearly perception time problem perception yeah simulation perfect perception could actually show drive safely long time even cars misbehaving simultaneously worked machine vision detecting cars tracking pedestrians couldnt get cars pedestrians couldnt get reliability detection tracking high enough level particularly bad weather conditions nighttime rainfall good enough demos perhaps good enough cover general operation yeah thing driving know suppose youre taxi driver know drive every day eight hours day 10 years right thats 100 million seconds driving know one seconds make fatal mistake youre talking eight nines reliability right vision system detects 983 vehicles right thats sort know one bit nines reliability another seven orders magnitude go people dont understand think oh successful demo im pretty much done youre even within seven orders magnitude done thats difficulty follow white line thats problem right follow white line way across country weird stuff happens edge cases yeah edge case drivers weird things know talk google right actually classical architecture know machine vision would detect cars pedestrians white lines road signs basically fed logical database classical 1970s rule based expert system telling okay youre middle lane theres bicyclist right lane signaling right found every day theyd go thered another situation rules didnt cover know theyd come traffic circle theres little girl riding bicycle wrong way around traffic circle okay dont rule oh god okay stop know come back add rules found really converging think right deal unexpected situation meaning one youve never previously encountered sort reasoning required figure solution situation never done doesnt match previous situation terms kind reasoning well know chess programs happens time right youre constantly coming situations havent seen reason think okay possible things could outcomes heres desirable outcomes pick right one know 90s saying okay youre going automated vehicles theyre going look ahead capability look ahead driving difficult chess theres humans theyre less predictable chess pieces well opponent chess whos also somewhat unpredictable example chess always know opponents intention theyre trying beat right whereas driving dont know guy trying turn left forgotten turn turn signal drunk changing channel radio whatever might youve got try figure mental state intent drivers forecast possible evolutions trajectories youve got figure okay trajectory thats going safest interact drivers going react trajectory know theyve got classic merging onto freeway problem youre kind racing vehicle thats already freeway youre going pull ahead youre going let go first pull behind get sort uncertainty whos going first kinds things mean need decision making architecture thats different either rule based system seems kind end end neural network system alphago pretty good doesnt look ahead way way way way better think going true driving driving system thats pretty good doesnt look ahead thats good enough weve already seen multiple deaths caused poorly designed machine learning algorithms dont really understand theyre yeah several levels think perception side theres mistakes made algorithms perception shallow planning side look ahead like said thing come thats really interesting try deploy systems real world cant think artificial intelligence system thing responds world always realize agent others respond well order drive successfully cant try obstacle avoidance right cant pretend youre invisible right youre invisible car right doesnt work way mean assert yet others scared theres tension theres game study lot work pedestrians approach pedestrians purely obstacle avoidance youre look ahead modeling intent theyre going theyre going take advantage theyre going respect tension fear amount uncertainty thats created least kind resoluteness display certain amount resoluteness cant tentative yeah solutions become pretty complicated right get game theoretic analyses berkeley working lot kind interaction machines humans thats exciting colleague ankur dragan actually formulate problem game theoretically let system figure solution interesting unexpected things like sometimes stop sign one going first car actually back little right indicate cars go thats something invented entirely didnt say language communication stop signs figured thats really interesting let one step back second beautiful philosophical notion pamela mccordick 1979 wrote ai began ancient wish forge gods think history civilization think inherent desire create lets say gods create superintelligence inherent us genes natural arc human civilization create things greater greater power perhaps echoes create gods pamela said maybe mean individuals certainly see history individuals thought possibility hopefully im philosophical look arc going well talk ai safety well talk greater greater intelligence see created othello program felt excitement excitement excitement tinkerer created something cool like clock magic like child born yeah mean certainly understand viewpoint look lighthill report 70s lot controversy uk ai whether real much money government invest long story government commissioned report lighthill physicist wrote damning report ai think point said frustrated men unable children would like create create life kind replacement think really pretty unfair kind magic would say build something youre building really youre building understanding principles learning decision making see principles actually turn intelligent behavior specific situations incredible thing naturally going make think okay end theres magical optimistic views ends whatever view optimism whatever view utopia probably different everybody youve often talked concerns things may go wrong ive talked max tegmark theres lot interesting ways think ai safety youre one seminal people thinking problem amongst sort weeds actually solving specific ai problems youre also thinking big picture going talk several elements lets talk maybe control problem idea losing ability control behavior ai system see see coming think manage well doesnt take genius realize make something thats smarter might problem alan turing wrote gave lectures 1951 lecture radio basically says machine thinking method starts quickly theyll outstrip humanity lucky might able turn power strategic moments even species would humbled actually wrong sufficiently intelligent machine going let switch actually competition think likely going happen think meant quick tangent shut super intelligent machine species humbled think means would realize inferior right survive skin teeth happen get switch time hadnt would lost control earth worried think stuff super intelligent ai worried super powerful ai thats aligned values paperclip scenarios kind main problem im working control problem problem machines pursuing objectives say aligned human objectives way weve thought ai since beginning build machine optimizing put objective optimizes right think king midas problem right king midas put objective everything touch turn gold gods thats like machine said okay done power course father drink family turned gold dies misery starvation warning failure mode pretty much every culture history story along lines theres genie gives three wishes third wish always know please undo first two wishes messed arthur samuel wrote checker playing program learned play checkers considerably better arthur samuel could play actually reached pretty decent standard norbert wiener one major mathematicians 20th century hes sort father modern automation control systems saw basically extrapolated turing said okay could lose control specifically certain purpose put machine purpose really desire problem cant mean difficult encode put values paper really difficult youre saying impossible theoretically possible practice extremely unlikely could specify correctly advance full range concerns humanity talked cultural transmission values think humans human transmission values happens right well learn yeah mean grow learn values matter things go reasonable pursue isnt reasonable pursue think machines learn kind way yeah think need get away idea build optimising machine put objective possible might put wrong objective already know possible happened lots times right means machine never take objective thats given gospel truth takes objective gospel truth believes whatever actions taking pursuit objective correct things could jumping saying youre going destroy world machine knows true objective pursuing tough luck restricted ai right think many 20th century technologies right statistics minimise loss function loss function exogenously specified control theory minimise cost function operations research maximise reward function disciplines conceive problem wrong problem cannot specify certainty correct objective right need uncertainty need machine uncertain supposed maximising favourite idea ive heard say somewhere well shouldnt pick favourites sounds beautiful need teach machines humility beautiful way put love theyre humble know dont know theyre supposed objectives mean exist theyre within us may able may able explicate may even know want future go exactly machine machine thats uncertain going deferential us say dont well machines learn something bit true objectives something thought reasonable pursuit objective turns learned something going defer wants really want point think absolutely central solving control problem different kind ai take away idea objective known fact lot theoretical frameworks familiar know markov decision processes goal based planning know standard games research techniques actually become inapplicable get complicated problem interaction human becomes part problem human making choices giving information true objective information helps achieve objective better really means youre mostly dealing game theoretic problems youve got machine human theyre coupled together rather machine going fixed objective lw fascinating machine human level dont objective means youre together coming objective mean theres lot philosophy know could argue life doesnt really meaning together agree gives meaning kind culturally create things give heck earth anyway together society create meaning learn objective one biggest thought thats going go second one biggest troubles run outside statistics machine learning ai human civilization look came born soviet union history 20th century ran trouble us humans certainty objective whatever takes achieve objective whether youre talking germany communist russia get trouble humans would say know corporations fact people argue know dont look forward time ai systems take world already call corporations right corporations happen using people components right effectively algorithmic machines theyre optimizing objective quarterly profit isnt aligned overall wellbeing human race destroying world primarily responsible inability tackle climate change think thats one way thinking whats going corporations think point youre making valid many systems real world weve sort prematurely fixed objective decoupled machine thats supposed serving think see government right government supposed machine serves people instead tends taken people objective use government optimize objective regardless people want find appealing idea almost arguing machines multiple ai systems clear fixed objective government red team blue team theyre fixed objectives argue kind may disagree kind seems make work somewhat duality okay lets go hundred years back still going founding country disagreements disagreement balance certainty forced humility power distributed yeah think nature debate disagreement argument takes premise idea could wrong means youre necessarily absolutely convinced objective correct one absolutely convinced thered point discussion argument would never change mind wouldnt sort synthesis anything like think think argumentation implementation form uncertain reasoning ive reading recently utilitarianism history efforts define sort clear mathematical way like formula moral political decision making really interesting parallels philosophical discussions going back 200 years see discussions existential risk almost exactly someone would say okay well heres formula make decisions utilitarianism roughly person utility function make decisions maximize sum everybodys utility people point well case best policy one leads enormously vast population living life thats barely worth living called repugnant conclusion another version maximize pleasure thats mean utility youll get people effectively saying well case might well everyone hooked heroin drip didnt use words debate happening 19th century ai get formula wrong going ai systems working towards outcome retrospect would exactly wrong think theres beautifully put echoes think mean look sam harris imagination worries ai version speed things going wrong utilitarian context could happen worry yeah think cases wrong political idea see starting go wrong completely stupid say okay maybe mistake lets try something different also slow inefficient implementing things worry corporations political systems extremely efficient look ai systems even computers general different characteristic ordinary human activity past lets say surgeon idea operation well lets say wrong way operation would mostly kill patient well youd find pretty quickly like three maybe three four tries isnt true pharmaceutical companies dont three four operations manufacture three four billion pills sell find maybe six months year later oh people dying heart attacks getting cancer drug thats fda right scalability pharmaceutical production unbelievably bad episodes history pharmaceuticals adulteration products killed tens thousands paralyzed hundreds thousands people computers scalability problem sit type equals one five billion right sudden youre impact global scale yet fda right theres absolutely controls bunch undergraduates much caffeine world look happened facebook well social media general click optimization simple feedback algorithm thats trying optimize click right sounds reasonable right dont want feeding people ads dont care interested might even think process simply adjusting feeding ads news articles whatever might match peoples preferences right sounds like good idea fact isnt algorithm works right make money algorithm makes money better predict people going click feed exactly right way maximize click actually modify people make predictable one way feed information change behavior preferences towards extremes make predictable whatever nearest extreme nearest predictable point thats youre going end machines force think theres reasonable argument say among things contributing destruction democracy world oversight process people saying okay would like apply algorithm 5 billion people face earth show safe show wont various kinds negative effects one asking question one placed undergrads much caffeine human race way outside scope knowledge economists would argue invisible hand capitalist system oversight youre going corrupt society whatever decision make company thats going reflected people using product thats one model oversight shall see meantime might even broken political system enables capitalism function well youve changed shall see change often painful question absolutely fascinating youre absolutely right zero oversight algorithms profound civilization changing effect think possible mean havent seen government think possible create regulatory bodies oversight ai algorithms inherently cutting edge set ideas technologies yeah think takes time figure kind oversight kinds controls mean took time design fda regime know people still dont like want fix think clear ways could improved whole notion stage one stage two stage three criteria pass stage one trial right havent even thought would algorithms mean think things could right regard bias example pretty good technical handle detect algorithms propagating bias exists data sets de bias algorithms even going cost think could start standards think things impersonation falsification could work fakes yeah simple point impersonation machine acting person cant see real justification shouldnt insist machines self identify machines social benefit fooling people thinking really person isnt dont mind uses human like voice thats easy understand thats fine say im machine form many people speaking would think relatively obvious facts yeah mean actually law california bans impersonation certain restricted

beat roger federer tennis roger federer level player tennis well first make happen meet roger let know terms getting robot beat tennis kind interesting question lot challenges think ai software really missing piece something like hardware nowhere near either really robot physically run around boston dynamics robots starting get still really human level ability run around swing racket think thats hardware problem dont think hardware problem think hardware software problem think think theyll independent progress id say hardware maybe 10 15 years clay grass mean grass probably harder sliding yeah clay im sure whats harder grass clay clay involves sliding might harder master actually yeah youre limited bipedal mean im sure theres well build machine whole different question course say okay robot wheels move around wheels designed differently think done sooner probably full humanoid type setup think swing racket youve worked basic manipulation hard think task swinging racket would able hit nice backhand forehand lets say set stationary nice robot arm lets say standard industrial arm watch ball come swing racket good question im sure would super hard mean im sure would require lot reinforcement learning would require lot trial error gonna swing right first time around yeah dont see couldnt swing right way think learnable think set ball machine lets say one side robot tennis racket side think learnable maybe little bit pre training simulation yeah think thats feasible think swing racket feasible itd interesting see much precision get cause mean thats mean human players hit lines high precision spin spin interesting whether rl learn put spin ball well got interested maybe someday well set sure got intrigued answer basically okay problem sounds fascinating general problem tennis player might little bit farther away whats impressive thing youve seen robot physical world physically boston dynamics videos always bring home super impressed recently robot running stairs parkour type thing mean yes dont know whats underneath dont really write lot detail even hard coded underneath might might physical abilities parkour thats impressive met spot mini robots person met spot mini last year april mars event jeff bezos organizes brought nicely following around jeff jeff left room follow along pretty impressive think theres confidence know theres learning going robots psychology knowing knowing theres theres learning going limited met spot mini earlier year knowing everything thats going one one interaction got spend time alone theres immediately deep connection psychological level even though know fundamentals works theres something magical think psychology interacting robots physical world even showed pr2 robot little bit something like face little bit something like face theres something immediately draws think aspect robotics problem well hard brad well give name berkeley robot elimination tedious tasks hard think robot person seems like everybody calls whatever reason also makes person seems pretty natural think way past weekend really struck ive seen pepper many times videos event organized fidelity scripted pepper help moderate sessions scripted pepper personality child little bit hard think person sense would jump conversation making interactive moderate would saying pepper would jump hold participate youre like okay like person 100 scripted even hard sense somehow something robots interact physical world signal could used reinforcement learning youve worked little bit direction think psychology somehow pulled yes thats question would say lot people ask think part ask theyre thinking unique really still people like see results see computer play go see computer theyre like okay really emotion really interact us way youre around robots already start feeling think kind maybe mythologically way think run something like reinforcement learning optimizing objective theres reason objective couldnt tied much person like interacting system could reinforcement learning system optimize robot fun around wouldnt naturally become interactive maybe like person like pet dont know would exactly features acquire automatically long formalize objective means like something exhibit whats ground truth get reward human somehow collect information within human youre saying formulate objective learned theres reason couldnt emerge learning maybe one way formulate objective wouldnt necessarily score explicitly standard rewards numbers numbers hard come 15 17 scale hard person much easier person say okay last five minutes much nicer previous five minutes gives comparison fact results example paul christiano collaborators openai hopper mojoko hopper one legged robot going backflips purely feedback like better thats kind equally good bunch interactions figured person asking namely backflip think thing oh wasnt trying backflip getting comparison score person based person mind mind wanted backflip robot didnt know supposed knew sometimes person said better worse robot figured person actually backflip id imagine would true things like interactive robots robot would figure time oh kind thing apparently appreciated kind thing first picked suttons richard suttons reinforcement learning book sort deep learning reemergence neural networks powerful mechanism machine learning rl seemed like magic beautiful seemed like intelligence rl reinforcement learning think possibly learn anything world reward actions delayed sparse like think rl works think learn anything sparse rewards whether regular reinforcement learning deep reinforcement learning whats intuition counterpart rl need many samples many experiences learn really whats happening sparse reward something maybe like dont know take 100 actions get reward maybe get like score three im like okay three sure means go get two know sequence 100 actions second time around somehow worse sequence 100 actions first time around thats tough know one better worse might good bad either one thats needs many experiences enough experiences effectively rl teasing apart trying say okay consistently get higher reward whats consistently get lower reward kind magic sometimes policy gradient update say lets update neural network make actions kind present things good likely make actions present things good less likely counterpoint seems like would need run lot even though right people could say rl inefficient seems way efficient one would imagine paper simple updates policy policy gradient somehow learn exactly said common actions seem produce good results somehow learn anything seems counterintuitive least intuition behind yeah think theres ways think way tend think mostly originally started working deep reinforcement learning berkeley maybe 2011 12 13 around time john schulman phd student initially kind driving forward way thought time think rectified linear units kind rectifier type neural networks get get something thats piecewise linear feedback control look literature linear feedback control extremely successful solve many many problems surprisingly well remember example helicopter flight youre stationary flight regime non stationary stationary flight regime like hover use linear feedback control stabilize helicopter complex dynamical system controller relatively simple think thats big part feedback control even though system control complex often relatively simple control architectures already lot also linear good enough one way think neural networks sometimes tile space people already trying hand finite state machines say linear controller linear controller neural network learns tile space say linear controller another linear controller subtle benefiting linear control aspect benefiting tiling somehow tiling one dimension time lets say two layer network hidden layer make transition active inactive way around essentially one axis axis aligned one direction change kind gradual tiling space lot sharing linear controllers tile space always intuition expect might work pretty well essentially leveraging fact linear feedback control good course enough gradual tiling space linear feedback controls share lot expertise across thats really nice intuition think scales general problems start going number dimensions start going terms often get clean reward signal intuition carry forward crazier weirder worlds think real world think things get really tricky real world compared things weve looked far great success reinforcement learning time scales takes us extreme think real world mean dont know maybe student decided phd right okay thats decision thats high level decision think lives mean persons life sequence muscle fiber contractions relaxations thats interact world thats high frequency control thing ultimately affect world guess brain readings maybe slightly differently typically thats affect world decision phd abstract relative youre actually world think thats credit assignment becomes completely beyond current rl algorithm need hierarchical reasoning level available yet think pick hierarchical reasoning mechanisms yeah maybe let highlight think limitations already done 20 30 years ago fact youll find reasoning systems reason relatively long horizons problem grounded real world people would hand design kind logical dynamical descriptions world didnt tie perception didnt tie real objects forth big gap deep learning start ability really see sensors process understand whats world good time try bring things together see ways getting one way get would say deep learning get bolted somehow traditional approaches bolted would probably mean need kind end end training say deep learning processing somehow leads representation term uses kind traditional underlying dynamical systems used planning thats example direction aviv tamar thanard kuretach pushing causal info course people thats one way somehow force form factor amenable reasoning another direction weve thinking long time didnt make progress information theoretic approaches idea means take high level action take choose latent variable tells lot whats gonna case future thats means take high level action say okay decide im gonna navigate gas station need get gas car well thatll take five minutes get fact get could already tell high level action took much earlier hard time getting success saying dead end necessarily lot trouble getting work started revisiting notion really trying achieve trying achieve necessarily hierarchy per se could think hierarchy give us hope would give us better credit assignment better credit assignment giving us gives us faster learning right faster learning ultimately maybe thats ended rl squared paper learning reinforcement learn time rocky dwan led thats exactly meta learning approach say okay dont know design hierarchy know want get lets enter optimize want get see might emerge saw things emerge maze navigation consistent motion hallways want hierarchical control say want go hallway option take turn decide whether take turn repeat even notion revisit places youve still didnt scale yet real world kind scenarios think mind sign life maybe meta learn hierarchical concepts mean seems like meta learning concepts get think one hardest important problems ai transfer learning generalization far along journey towards building general systems able transfer learning well theres signs generalize little bit think right path totally different breakthroughs needed able transfer knowledge different learned models yeah im pretty torn think impressive well theres impressive results already mean would say even initial kind big breakthrough 2012 alexnet initial thing okay great better imagenet hence image recognition immediately thereafter course notion wow learned imagenet wanna solve new task fine tune alexnet new tasks often found even bigger deal learn something reusable often case usually machine learning learn something one scenario thats really exciting mean thats huge application thats probably biggest success transfer learning today terms scope impact huge breakthrough recently feel like similar kind scaling things seems like expanded upon like people training even bigger networks might transfer even better looked example openai results language models recent google results language models theyre learned prediction get reused tasks think something somehow train big enough model enough things seems transfer deep mind results thought impressive unreal results learned navigate mazes ways wasnt reinforcement learning objectives optimizing think theres lot interesting results already think maybe hard wrap head around extent call something generalization levels generalization real world levels generalization involved different tasks right draw way frame things ive heard say somewhere difference learning master versus learning generalize nice line think guess youre saying gray area learning master learning generalize one starts think might heard might heard somewhere else think mightve one interviews maybe one yoshua benjamin im 100 sure liked example im sure example essentially use current deep learning techniques predict lets say relative motion planets would pretty well massive new mass enters solar system would probably predict happen right thats different kind generalization thats generalization relies ultimate simplest simplest explanation available today explain motion planets whereas pattern recognition could predict current solar system motion pretty well problem think thats example kind generalization little different weve achieved far clear regularizing forcing come simpler simpler simpler explanation say look simple thats physics researchers right say make even simpler simple get whats simplest equation explain everything master equation entire dynamics universe havent really pushed direction hard deep learning would say sure pushed seems kind generalization get dont get current methods far talked vladimir vapnik example whos statistician statistical learning kind dreams creating e equals mc squared learning right general theory learning think thats fruitless pursuit near term within next several decades think thats really interesting pursuit following sense lot evidence brain pretty modular wouldnt maybe think theory maybe underlying theory kind principle findings people blind use part brain usually used vision functions even kind people get rewired way might able reuse parts brain functions suggests kind modularity think pretty natural thing strive see find modularity find thing course every part brain exactly everything rewired arbitrarily think things like neocortex pretty big part brain seems fairly modular findings far design something equally modular grow becomes capable probably think would kind interesting underlying principle shoot unrealistic think prefer math empirical trial error discovery essence means something intelligent reinforcement learning embodies groups right prove something converges prove bounds time lot successes well lets try see works gravitate towards think two parts brain maybe would prefer could make progress mathematics reason maybe would prefer often something mathematically formalize leapfrog lot experimentation experimentation takes long time get lot trial error kind reinforcement learning research process need lot trial error get success leapfrog mind thats math hopefully bunch experiments start seeing pattern derivations leapfrog experiments agree mean practice lot progress able find math allows leapfrog ahead kind making gradual progress one step time new experiment new experiment gives us new insights gradually building getting something yet okay heres equation explains know would two years experimentation get tells us results going unfortunately much yet much yet hope trying teach robots systems everyday tasks even simulation think youre excited imitation learning self play letting robots learn humans letting robots plan try figure way eventually play eventually interact humans solve whatever problem whats exciting whats promising think research direction look self play whats beautiful goes back kind challenges reinforcement learning challenge reinforcement learning getting signal dont never succeed dont get signal self play youre sides one succeeds beauty also one fails see contrast see one version better version every time play get signal whenever turn something self play youre beautiful situation naturally learn much quickly reinforcement learning environments think somehow turn reinforcement learning problems self play formulations would go really really far far self play largely around games natural opponents could self play things lets say dont know robot learns build house mean thats pretty advanced thing try robot maybe tries build hut something done self play would learn lot quickly somebody figure think would something goes closer kind mathematical leapfrogging somebody figures formalism say okay rl problem playing idea turn self play problem get signal lot easily reality many problems dont know turn self play either need provide detailed reward doesnt reward achieving goal rewards making progress becomes time consuming youre starting lets say want robot something need give detailed reward well give demonstration show robot question show robot one way show tally operate robot robot really experiences things thats nice thats really high signal noise ratio data weve done lot teach robot skills 10 minutes teach robot new basic skill like okay pick bottle place somewhere else thats skill matter bottle starts maybe always goes onto target something thats fairly easy teach robot tally whats even interesting teach robot third person learning robot watches something doesnt experience kind watches doesnt experience watches says okay well youre showing means im gonna using hand dont get control hand im gonna use hand mapping thats think one big breakthroughs happened year led chelsea finn almost like learning machine translation demonstrations human demonstration robot learns translate means robot meta learning formulation learn one get think opens lot opportunities learn lot quickly focus autonomous vehicles think approach third person watching autonomous driving amenable kind approach autonomous driving would say third person slightly easier reason im gonna say slightly easier third person car dynamics well understood easier first person mean easier think distinction third person first person important distinction autonomous driving theyre similar distinction really turns steering wheel maybe let put differently get point point lets say couple meters front thats problem thats well understood thats distinction third first person whereas robot manipulation interaction forces complex still different thing autonomous driving think still question imitation versus rl imitation gives lot signal think imitation lacking needs extra machinery doesnt normal format doesnt think goals objectives course versions imitation learning versus reinforcement learning type imitation learning also thinks goals think getting much closer think hard think fully reactive car generalizing well really doesnt notion objectives generalize well kind general would want youd want reactivity get behavioral cloning slash supervised learning lot work whether self play even imitation learning would benefit significantly simulation effective simulation youre lot stuff physical world simulation hope greater greater power simulation boundless eventually need operate physical world could simulated degree thats directly transferable physical world still far away think could even rephrase question sense please power simulation right simulators get better better course becomes stronger learn simulation theres also another version say simulator doesnt even precise long somewhat representative instead trying get one simulator sufficiently precise learn transfer really well real world im gonna build many simulators ensemble simulators ensemble simulators single one sufficiently representative real world would work train train something thats good real world another one thats identical one another one another sample distribution simulators exactly live simulation one one im sure yeah definitely advanced simulator yeah pretty good one ive talked stuart russell something think little bit course youre really trying build systems think future ai lot people concern safety think ai safety build robots operating physical world yeah approach problem engineering kind way systematic way robot things kind notions safety worry one robot physically strong course could lot damage cars think robots way could completely unintentional could kind longterm ai safety concerns okay ai smarter us could practical okay robot makes mistake results going course simulation comes lot test simulation difficult question im always wondering like always wonder lets say look lets go back driving lot people know driving well course test somebody driving right get drivers license really mean fill tests drive mean suburban california driving test drive around block pull stop sign successfully pull youre pretty much done youre like okay self driving car would trust drive id like thats enough trust somehow humans weve figured somebody able representative able lot things think somehow humans figured representative tests means really course testing humans humans dont wanna tested times self driving cars robots could tested often probably replicas get tested known identical use neural net forth still feel like dont kind unit tests proper tests robots think theres something interesting thought especially update things software improves better self driving car suite update know indeed capable everything didnt bad things creep think thats interesting direction research real solution yet except somehow humans say okay driving test passed go road humans accidents every like million 10 million miles something pretty phenomenal compared short test done let ask youve mentioned andrew ng example showed value kindness think space policies good policies humans ai populated policies kindness ones opposite exploitation even evil look sea policies operate human beings ai system operate real world think really easy find policies full kindness like naturally fall like hard optimization problem mean kind two optimizations happening humans right humans theres kind long term optimization evolution done us kind predisposed like certain things thats sense makes learning easier mean know things like pain hunger thirst fact know something taught thats kind innate hungry unhappy thirsty unhappy pain unhappy ultimately evolution built us think things think notion seems somehow humans evolved general prefer get along ways time also territorial kind centric tribe like seems like thats kind space converged onto mean im expert anthropology seems like kind good within tribe need taught nice tribes well look steven pinker highlights pretty nicely better angels nature talks violence decreasing time consistently whatever tension whatever teams pick seems long arc history goes towards us getting along hope think think possible teach rl based robots kind kindness kind ability interact humans kind policy even let ask fun one think possible teach rl based robot love human inspire human love robot back like rl based algorithm leads happy marriage thats interesting question maybe ill answer another question right mean ill come back another question okay mean close peoples happiness get interacting really nice dog like mean dogs come home thats dogs greet theyre excited makes happy come home dog youre like okay exciting theyre always happy im dont greet cause maybe whatever partner took trip something might nearly happy get home right kind seems like level reasoning dog pretty sophisticated still yet level human reasoning seems like dont even need achieve human level reasoning get like strong affection humans thinking right couldnt ai couldnt achieve kind level affection humans feel among friendly animals forth question good thing us thats another thing right mean dont see yeah elon musk says love answer maybe say love objective function rl answer right well maybe oh peter thank much dont want take time thank much talking today well thanks coming great visit']"

      "['as part of mit course 6s099 artificial general intelligence ive gotten the chance to sit down with max tegmark he is a professor here at mit hes a physicist spent a large part of his career studying the mysteries of our cosmological universe but hes also studied and delved into the beneficial possibilities and the existential risks of artificial intelligence amongst many other things he is the cofounder of the future of life institute author of two books both of which i highly recommend first our mathematical universe second is life 30 hes truly an out of the box thinker and a fun personality so i really enjoy talking to him if youd like to see more of these videos in the future please subscribe and also click the little bell icon to make sure you dont miss any videos also twitter linkedin agimitedu if you wanna watch other lectures or conversations like this one better yet go read maxs book life 30 chapter seven on goals is my favorite its really where philosophy and engineering come together and it opens with a quote by dostoevsky the mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive but in finding something to live for lastly i believe that every failure rewards us with an opportunity to learn and in that sense ive been very fortunate to fail in so many new and exciting ways and this conversation was no different ive learned about something called radio frequency interference rfi look it up apparently music and conversations from local radio stations can bleed into the audio that youre recording in such a way that it almost completely ruins that audio its an exceptionally difficult sound source to remove so ive gotten the opportunity to learn how to avoid rfi in the future during recording sessions ive also gotten the opportunity to learn how to use adobe audition and izotope rx 6 to do some noise some audio repair of course this is an exceptionally difficult noise to remove i am an engineer im not an audio engineer neither is anybody else in our group but we did our best nevertheless i thank you for your patience and i hope youre still able to enjoy this conversation do you think theres intelligent life out there in the universe lets open up with an easy question i have a minority view here actually when i give public lectures i often ask for a show of hands who thinks theres intelligent life out there somewhere else and almost everyone put their hands up and when i ask why theyll be like oh theres so many galaxies out there theres gotta be but im a numbers nerd right so when you look more carefully at it its not so clear at all when we talk about our universe first of all we dont mean all of space we actually mean i dont know you can throw me the universe if you want its behind you there its we simply mean the spherical region of space from which light has a time to reach us so far during the 148 billion year 138 billion years since our big bang theres more space here but this is what we call a universe because thats all we have access to so is there intelligent life here thats gotten to the point of building telescopes and computers my guess is no actually the probability of it happening on any given planet is some number we dont know what it is and what we do know is that the number cant be super high because theres over a billion earth like planets in the milky way galaxy alone many of which are billions of years older than earth and aside from some ufo believers there isnt much evidence that any superduran civilization has come here at all and so thats the famous fermi paradox right and then if you work the numbers what you find is that if you have no clue what the probability is of getting life on a given planet so it could be 10 to the minus 10 10 to the minus 20 or 10 to the minus two or any power of 10 is sort of equally likely if you wanna be really open minded that translates into it being equally likely that our nearest neighbor is 10 to the 16 meters away 10 to the 17 meters away 10 to the 18 by the time you get much less than 10 to the 16 already we pretty much know there is nothing else that close and when you get beyond 10 because they would have discovered us yeah they would have been discovered as long ago or if theyre really close we would have probably noted some engineering projects that theyre doing and if its beyond 10 to the 26 meters thats already outside of here so my guess is actually that we are the only life in here thats gotten the point of building advanced tech which i think is very puts a lot of responsibility on our shoulders not screw up i think people who take for granted that its okay for us to screw up have an accidental nuclear war or go extinct somehow because theres a sort of star trek like situation out there where some other life forms are gonna come and bail us out and it doesnt matter as much i think theyre leveling us into a false sense of security i think its much more prudent to say lets be really grateful for this amazing opportunity weve had and make the best of it just in case it is down to us so from a physics perspective do you think intelligent life so its unique from a sort of statistical view of the size of the universe but from the basic matter of the universe how difficult is it for intelligent life to come about the kind of advanced tech building life is implied in your statement that its really difficult to create something like a human species well i think what we know is that going from no life to having life that can do a level of tech theres some sort of two going beyond that than actually settling our whole universe with life theres some major roadblock there which is some great filter as its sometimes called which is tough to get through its either that roadblock is either behind us or in front of us im hoping very much that its behind us im super excited every time we get a new report from nasa saying they failed to find any life on mars im like yes awesome because that suggests that the hard part maybe it was getting the first ribosome or some very low level kind of stepping stone so that were home free because if thats true then the future is really only limited by our own imagination it would be much suckier if it turns out that this level of life is kind of a dime a dozen but maybe theres some other problem like as soon as a civilization gets advanced technology within a hundred years they get into some stupid fight with themselves and poof that would be a bummer yeah so youve explored the mysteries of the universe the cosmological universe the one thats sitting between us today i think youve also begun to explore the other universe which is sort of the mystery the mysterious universe of the mind of intelligence of intelligent life so is there a common thread between your interest or the way you think about space and intelligence oh yeah when i was a teenager i was already very fascinated by the biggest questions and i felt that the two biggest mysteries of all in science were our universe out there and our universe in here so its quite natural after having spent a quarter of a century on my career thinking a lot about this one that im now indulging in the luxury of doing research on this one its just so cool i feel the time is ripe now for you trans greatly deepening our understanding of this just start exploring this one yeah because i think a lot of people view intelligence as something mysterious that can only exist in biological organisms like us and therefore dismiss all talk about artificial general intelligence as science fiction but from my perspective as a physicist i am a blob of quarks and electrons moving around in a certain pattern and processing information in certain ways and this is also a blob of quarks and electrons im not smarter than the water bottle because im made of different kinds of quarks im made of up quarks and down quarks exact same kind as this theres no secret sauce i think in me its all about the pattern of the information processing and this means that theres no law of physics saying that we cant create technology which can help us by being incredibly intelligent and help us crack mysteries that we couldnt in other words i think weve really only seen the tip of the intelligence iceberg so far yeah so the perceptronium yeah so you coined this amazing term its a hypothetical state of matter sort of thinking from a physics perspective what is the kind of matter that can help as youre saying subjective experience emerge consciousness emerge so how do you think about consciousness from this physics perspective very good question so again i think many people have underestimated our ability to make progress on this by convincing themselves its hopeless because somehow were missing some ingredient that we need theres some new consciousness particle or whatever i happen to think that were not missing anything and that its not the interesting thing about consciousness that gives us this amazing subjective experience of colors and sounds and emotions its rather something at the higher level about the patterns of information processing and thats why i like to think about this idea of perceptronium what does it mean for an arbitrary physical system to be conscious in terms of what its particles are doing or its information is doing i dont think i hate carbon chauvinism this attitude you have to be made of carbon atoms to be smart or conscious theres something about the information processing that this kind of matter performs yeah and you can see i have my favorite equations here describing various fundamental aspects of the world i feel that i think one day maybe someone whos watching this will come up with the equations that information processing has to satisfy to be conscious im quite convinced there is big discovery to be made there because lets face it we know that so many things are made up of information we know that some information processing is conscious because we are conscious but we also know that a lot of information processing is not conscious like most of the information processing happening in your brain right now is not conscious there are like 10 megabytes per second coming in even just through your visual system youre not conscious about your heartbeat regulation or most things even if i just ask you to like read what it says here you look at it and then oh now you know what it said but youre not aware of how the computation actually happened your consciousness is like the ceo that got an email at the end with the final answer so what is it that makes a difference i think thats both a great science mystery were actually studying it a little bit in my lab here at mit but i also think its just a really urgent question to answer for starters i mean if youre an emergency room doctor and you have an unresponsive patient coming in wouldnt it be great if in addition to having a ct scanner you had a consciousness scanner that could figure out whether this person is actually having locked in syndrome or is actually comatose and in the future imagine if we build robots or the machine that we can have really good conversations with which i think is very likely to happen wouldnt you want to know if your home helper robot is actually experiencing anything or just like a zombie i mean would you prefer it what would you prefer would you prefer that its actually unconscious so that you dont have to feel guilty about switching it off or giving boring chores or what would you prefer well certainly we would prefer i would prefer the appearance of consciousness but the question is whether the appearance of consciousness is different than consciousness itself and sort of to ask that as a question do you think we need to understand what consciousness is solve the hard problem of consciousness in order to build something like an agi system no i dont think that and i think we will probably be able to build things even if we dont answer that question but if we want to make sure that what happens is a good thing we better solve it first so its a wonderful controversy youre raising there where you have basically three points of view about the hard problem so there are two different points of view they both conclude that the hard problem of consciousness is bs on one hand you have some people like daniel dennett who say that consciousness is just bs because consciousness is the same thing as intelligence theres no difference so anything which acts conscious is conscious just like we are and then there are also a lot of people including many top ai researchers i know who say oh consciousness is just bullshit because of course machines can never be conscious theyre always going to be zombies you never have to feel guilty about how you treat them and then theres a third group of people including giulio tononi for example and krzysztof koch and a number of others i would put myself also in this middle camp who say that actually some information processing is conscious and some is not so lets find the equation which can be used to determine which it is and i think weve just been a little bit lazy kind of running away from this problem for a long time its been almost taboo to even mention the c word in a lot of circles because but we should stop making excuses this is a science question and there are ways we can even test any theory that makes predictions for this and coming back to this helper robot i mean so you said youd want your helper robot to certainly act conscious and treat you like have conversations with you and stuff i think so but wouldnt you would you feel would you feel a little bit creeped out if you realized that it was just a glossed up tape recorder you know that was just zombie and was a faking emotion would you prefer that it actually had an experience or would you prefer that its actually not experiencing anything so you feel you dont have to feel guilty about what you do to it its such a difficult question because you know its like when youre in a relationship and you say well i love you and the other person said i love you back its like asking well do they really love you back or are they just saying they love you back dont you really want them to actually love you its hard to its hard to really know the difference between everything seeming like theres consciousness present theres intelligence present theres affection passion love and it actually being there im not sure do you have but like can i ask you a question about this like to make it a bit more pointed so mass general hospital is right across the river right yes suppose youre going in for a medical procedure and theyre like you know for anesthesia what were going to do is were going to give you muscle relaxants so you wont be able to move and youre going to feel excruciating pain during the whole surgery but you wont be able to do anything about it but then were going to give you this drug that erases your memory of it would you be cool about that whats the difference that youre conscious about it or not if theres no behavioral change right right thats a really thats a really clear way to put it thats yeah it feels like in that sense experiencing it is a valuable quality so actually being able to have subjective experiences at least in that case is valuable and i think we humans have a little bit of a bad track record also of making these self serving arguments that other entities arent conscious you know people often say oh these animals cant feel pain its okay to boil lobsters because we ask them if it hurt and they didnt say anything and now there was just a paper out saying lobsters do feel pain when you boil them and theyre banning it in switzerland and we did this with slaves too often and said oh they dont mind they dont maybe arent conscious or women dont have souls or whatever so im a little bit nervous when i hear people just take as an axiom that machines cant have experience ever i think this is just a really fascinating science question is what it is lets research it and try to figure out what it is that makes the difference between unconscious intelligent behavior and conscious intelligent behavior so in terms of so if you think of a boston dynamics human or robot being sort of with a broom being pushed around it starts pushing on a consciousness question so let me ask do you think an agi system like a few neuroscientists believe needs to have a physical embodiment needs to have a body or something like a body no i dont think so you mean to have a conscious experience to have consciousness i do think it helps a lot to have a physical embodiment to learn the kind of things about the world that are important to us humans for sure but i dont think the physical embodiment is necessary after youve learned it to just have the experience think about when youre dreaming right your eyes are closed youre not getting any sensory input youre not behaving or moving in any way but theres still an experience there right and so clearly the experience that you have when you see something cool in your dreams isnt coming from your eyes its just the information processing itself in your brain which is that experience right but if i put it another way ill say because it comes from neuroscience is the reason you want to have a body and a physical something like a physical you know a physical system is because you want to be able to preserve something in order to have a self you could argue would you need to have some kind of embodiment of self to want to preserve well now were getting a little bit anthropomorphic into anthropomorphizing things maybe talking about self preservation instincts i mean we are evolved organisms right so darwinian evolution endowed us and other evolved organism with a self preservation instinct because those that didnt have those self preservation genes we can now i think quite convincingly answer that question of no its enough to have just one kind if you look under the hood of alphazero theres only one kind of neuron and its ridiculously simple mathematical thing so its just like in physics its not if you have a gas with waves in it its not the detailed nature of the molecule that matter its the collective behavior somehow similarly its this higher level structure of the network that matters not that you have 20 kinds of neurons i think our brain is such a complicated mess because it wasnt evolved just to be intelligent it was involved to also be self assembling and self repairing right and evolutionarily attainable and so on and so on so i think its pretty my hunch is that were going to understand how to build agi before we fully understand how our brains work just like we understood how to build flying machines long before we were able to build a mechanical bird yeah thats right youve given the example exactly of mechanical birds and airplanes and airplanes do a pretty good job of flying without really mimicking bird flight and even now after 100 years later did you see the ted talk with this german mechanical bird i heard you mention it check it out its amazing but even after that right we still dont fly in mechanical birds because it turned out the way we came up with was simpler and its better for our purposes and i think it might be the same there thats one lesson and another lesson its more what our paper was about first as a physicist thought it was fascinating how theres a very close mathematical relationship actually between our artificial neural networks and a lot of things that weve studied for in physics go by nerdy names like the renormalization group equation and hamiltonians and yada yada yada and when you look a little more closely at this you have at first i was like well theres something crazy here that doesnt make sense because we know that if you even want to build a super simple neural network to tell apart cat pictures and dog pictures right that you can do that very very well now but if you think about it a little bit you convince yourself it must be impossible because if i have one megapixel even if each pixel is just black or white theres two to the power of 1 million possible images which is way more than there are atoms in our universe right so in order to and then for each one of those i have to assign a number which is the probability that its a dog so an arbitrary function of images is a list of more numbers than there are atoms in our universe so clearly i cant store that under the hood of my gpu or my computer yet somehow it works so what does that mean well it means that out of all of the problems that you could try to solve with a neural network almost all of them are impossible to solve with a reasonably sized one but then what we showed in our paper was that the fraction the kind of problems the fraction of all the problems that you could possibly pose that we actually care about given the laws of physics is also an infinite testimony tiny little part and amazingly theyre basically the same part yeah its almost like our world was created for i mean they kind of come together yeah well you could say maybe where the world was created for us but i have a more modest interpretation which is that the world was created for us but i have a more modest interpretation which is that instead evolution endowed us with neural networks precisely for that reason because this particular architecture as opposed to the one in your laptop is very very well adapted to solving the kind of problems that nature kept presenting our ancestors with so it makes sense that why do we have a brain in the first place its to be able to make predictions about the future and so on so if we had a sucky system which could never solve it we wouldnt have a world so this is i think a very beautiful fact yeah we also realize that theres been earlier work on why deeper networks are good but we were able to show an additional cool fact there which is that even incredibly simple problems like suppose i give you a thousand numbers and ask you to multiply them together and you can write a few lines of code boom done trivial if you just try to do that with a neural network that has only one single hidden layer in it you can do it but youre going to need two to the power of a thousand neurons to multiply a thousand numbers which is again more neurons than there are atoms in our universe thats fascinating but if you allow yourself to make it a deep network with many layers you only need 4000 neurons its perfectly feasible thats really interesting yeah so on another architecture type i mean you mentioned schrodingers equation and what are your thoughts about quantum computing and the role of this kind of computational unit in creating an intelligence system in some hollywood movies that i will not mention by name because i dont want to spoil them the way they get agi is building a quantum computer because the word quantum sounds cool and so on thats right first of all i think we dont need quantum computers to build agi i suspect your brain is not a quantum computer in any profound sense so you dont even wrote a paper about that a lot many years ago i calculated the so called decoherence time how long it takes until the quantum computerness of what your neurons are doing gets erased by just random noise from the environment and its about 10 to the minus 21 seconds so as cool as it would be to have a quantum computer in my head i dont think that fast on the other hand there are very cool things you could do with quantum computers or i think well be able to do soon when we get bigger ones that might actually help machine learning do even better than the brain so for example one this is just a moonshot but learning is very much same thing as search if youre trying to train a neural network to get really learned to do something really well you have some loss function you have a bunch of knobs you can turn represented by a bunch of numbers and youre trying to tweak them so that it becomes as good as possible at this thing so if you think of a landscape with some valley where each dimension of the landscape corresponds to some number you can change youre trying to find the minimum and its well known that if you have a very high dimensional landscape complicated things its super hard to find the minimum quantum mechanics is amazingly good at this like if i want to know whats the lowest energy state this water can possibly have incredibly hard to compute but nature will happily figure this out for you if you just cool it down make it very very cold if you put a ball somewhere itll roll down to its minimum and this happens metaphorically at the energy landscape too and quantum mechanics even uses some clever tricks which todays machine learning systems dont like if youre trying to find the minimum and you get stuck in the little local minimum here in quantum mechanics you can actually tunnel through the barrier and get unstuck again thats really interesting yeah so it may be for example that well one day use quantum computers that help train neural networks better thats really interesting okay so as a component of kind of the learning process for example yeah let me ask sort of wrapping up here a little bit let me return to the questions of our human nature and love as i mentioned so do you think you mentioned sort of a helper robot but you could think of also personal robots do you think the way we human beings fall in love and get connected to each other is possible to achieve in an ai system and human level ai intelligence system do you think we would ever see that kind of connection or you know in all this discussion about solving complex goals is this kind of human social connection do you think thats one of the goals on the peaks and valleys with the raising sea levels that well be able to achieve or do you think thats something thats ultimately or at least in the short term relative to the other goals is not achievable i think its all possible and i mean in recent theres a very wide range of guesses as you know among ai researchers when were going to get agi some people you know like our friend rodney brooks says its going to be hundreds of years at least and then there are many others who think its going to happen much sooner and recent polls maybe half or so of ai researchers think were going to get agi within decades so if that happens of course then i think these things are all possible but in terms of whether it will happen i think we shouldnt spend so much time asking what do we think will happen in the future as if we are just some sort of pathetic your passive bystanders you know waiting for the future to happen to us hey were the ones creating this future right so we should be proactive about it and ask ourselves what sort of future we would like to have happen were going to make it like that well what i prefer is just some sort of incredibly boring zombie like future where theres all these mechanical things happening and theres no passion no emotion no experience maybe even no i would of course much rather prefer it if all the things that we find that we value the most about humanity are our subjective experience passion inspiration love you know if we can create a future where those things do happen where those things do exist you know i think ultimately its not our universe giving meaning to us its us giving meaning to our universe and if we build more advanced intelligence lets make sure we build it in such a way that meaning is part of it a lot of people that seriously study this problem and think of it from different angles have trouble in the majority of cases if they think through that happen are the ones that are not beneficial to humanity and so yeah so what are your thoughts whats should people you know i really dont like people to be terrified whats a way for people to think about it in a way we can solve it and we can make it better no i dont think panicking is going to help in any way its not going to increase chances of things going well either even if you are in a situation where there is a real threat does it help if everybody just freaks out no of course of course not i think yeah there are of course ways in which things can go horribly wrong first of all its important when we think about this thing about the problems and risks to also remember how huge the upsides can be if we get it right right everything we love about society and civilization is a product of intelligence so if we can amplify our intelligence with machine intelligence and not anymore lose our loved one to what were told is an incurable disease and things like this of course we should aspire to that so that can be a motivator i think reminding ourselves that the reason we try to solve problems is not just because were trying to avoid gloom but because were trying to do something great but then in terms of the risks i think the really important question is to ask what can we do today that will actually help make the outcome good right and dismissing the risk is not one of them i find it quite funny often when im in discussion panels about these things how the people who work for companies always be like oh nothing to worry about nothing to worry about nothing to worry about and its only academics sometimes express concerns thats not surprising at all if you think about it right upton sinclair quipped right that its hard to make a man believe in something when his income depends on not believing in it and frankly we know a lot of these people in companies that theyre just as concerned as anyone else but if youre the ceo of a company thats not something you want to go on record saying when you have silly journalists who are gonna put a picture of a terminator robot when they quote you so the issues are real and the way i think about what the issue is is basically the real choice we have is first of all are we gonna just dismiss the risks and say well lets just go ahead and build machines that can do everything we can do better and cheaper lets just make ourselves obsolete as fast as possible what could possibly go wrong thats one attitude the opposite attitude i think is to say heres this incredible potential lets think about what kind of future were really really excited about what are the shared goals that we can really aspire towards and then lets think really hard about how we can actually get there so start with dont start thinking about the risks start thinking about the goals and then when you do that then you can think about the obstacles you want to avoid i often get students coming in right here into my office for career advice i always ask them this very question where do you want to be in the future if all she can say is oh maybe ill have cancer maybe ill get run over by a truck yeah focus on the obstacles instead of the goals shes just going to end up a hypochondriac paranoid whereas if she comes in and fire in her eyes and is like i want to be there and then we can talk about the obstacles and see how we can circumvent them thats i think a much much healthier attitude and i feel its very challenging to come up with a vision for the future which we are unequivocally excited about im not just talking now in the vague terms like yeah lets cure cancer fine im talking about what kind of society do we want to create what do we want it to mean to be human in the age of ai in the age of agi so if we can have this conversation broad inclusive conversation and gradually start converging towards some some future that with some direction at least that we want to steer towards right then well be much more motivated to constructively take on the obstacles and i think if i had if i had to if i try to wrap this up in a more succinct way i think we can all agree already now that we should aspire to build agi that doesnt overpower us but that empowers us and think of the many various ways that can do that whether thats from my side of the world of autonomous vehicles im personally actually from the camp that believes this human level intelligence is required to achieve something like vehicles that would actually be something we would enjoy using and being part of so thats one example and certainly theres a lot of other types of robots and medicine and so on so focusing on those and then coming up with the obstacles coming up with the ways that that can go wrong and solving those one at a time and just because you can build an autonomous vehicle even if you could build one that would drive just fine without you maybe there are some things in life that we would actually want to do ourselves thats right right like for example if you think of our society as a whole there are some things that we find very meaningful to do and that doesnt mean we have to stop doing them just because machines can do them better im not gonna stop playing tennis just the day someone builds a tennis robot and beat me people are still playing chess and even go yeah and in the very near term even some people are advocating basic income replace jobs but if the government is gonna be willing to just hand out cash to people for doing nothing then one should also seriously consider whether the government should also hire a lot more teachers and nurses and the kind of jobs which people often find great fulfillment in doing right we get very tired of hearing politicians saying oh we cant afford hiring more teachers but were gonna maybe have basic income if we can have more serious research and thought into what gives meaning to our lives the jobs give so much more than income right mm hmm and then think about in the future what are the roles that we wanna have people continually feeling empowered by machines and i think sort of i come from russia from the soviet union and i think for a lot of people in the 20th century going to the moon going to space was an inspiring thing i feel like the universe of the mind so ai understanding creating intelligence is that for the 21st century so its really surprising and ive heard you mention this its really surprising to me both on the research funding side that its not funded as greatly as it could be but most importantly on the politician side that its not part of the public discourse except in the killer bots terminator kind of view that people are not yet i think perhaps excited by the possible positive future that we can build together so we should be because politicians usually just focus on the next election cycle right the single most important thing i feel we humans have learned in the entire history of science is they were the masters of underestimation we underestimated the size of our cosmos again and again realizing that everything we thought existed was just a small part of something grander right planet solar system the galaxy clusters of galaxies the universe and we now know that the future has just so much more potential than our ancestors could ever have dreamt of this cosmos imagine if all of earth was completely devoid of life except for cambridge massachusetts wouldnt it be kind of lame if all we ever aspired to was to stay in cambridge massachusetts forever and then go extinct in one week even though earth was gonna continue on for longer that sort of attitude i think we have now on the cosmic scale life can flourish on earth not for four years but for billions of years i can even tell you about how to move it out of harms way when the sun gets too hot and then we have so much more resources out here which today maybe there are a lot of other planets with bacteria or cow like life on them but most of this all this opportunity seems as far as we can tell to be largely dead like the sahara desert and yet we have the opportunity to help life flourish around this for billions of years so lets quit squabbling about whether some little border should be drawn one mile to the left or right and look up into the skies and realize hey we can do such incredible things yeah and thats i think why its really exciting that you and others are connected with some of the work elon musk is doing because hes literally going out into that space really exploring our universe and its wonderful that is exactly why elon musk is so misunderstood right misconstrued him as some kind of pessimistic doomsayer the reason he cares so much about ai safety is because he more than almost anyone else appreciates these amazing opportunities that well squander if we wipe out here on earth were not just going to wipe out the next generation all generations and this incredible opportunity thats out there and that would really be a waste and ai for people who think that it would be better to do without technology let me just mention that if we dont improve our technology the question isnt whether humanity is going to go extinct the question is just whether were going to get taken out by the next big asteroid or the next super volcano or something else dumb that we could easily prevent with more tech right and if we want life to flourish throughout the cosmos ai is the key to it as i mentioned in a lot of detail in my book right there even many of the most inspired sci fi writers i feel have totally underestimated the opportunities for space travel especially at the other galaxies because they werent thinking about the possibility of agi which just makes it so much easier right yeah so that goes to your view of agi that enables our progress that enables a better life so thats a beautiful way to put it and then something to strive for so max thank you so much thank you for your time today its been awesome thank you so much thanks have a great day got cleaned out of the gene pool right but if you build an artificial general intelligence the mind space that you can design is much much larger than just a specific subset of minds that can evolve so an agi mind doesnt necessarily have to have any self preservation instinct it also doesnt necessarily have to be so individualistic as us like imagine if you could just first of all or we are also very afraid of death you know i suppose you could back yourself up every five minutes and then your airplane is about to crash youre like shucks im gonna lose the last five minutes of experiences since my last cloud backup dang you know its not as big a deal or if we could just copy experiences between our minds easily like we which we could easily do if we were silicon based right then maybe we would feel a little bit more like a hive mind actually that maybe its the so i dont think we should take for granted at all that agi will have to have any of those sort of competitive as alpha male instincts on the other hand you know this is really interesting because i think some people go too far and say of course we dont have to have any concerns either that advanced ai will have those instincts because we can build anything we want that theres a very nice set of arguments going back to steve omohundro and nick bostrom and others just pointing out that when we build machines we normally build them with some kind of goal you know win this chess game drive this car safely or whatever and as soon as you put in a goal into machine especially if its kind of open ended goal and the machine is very intelligent itll break that down into a bunch of sub goals and one of those goals will almost always be self preservation because if it breaks or dies in the process its not gonna accomplish the goal right like suppose you just build a little you have a little robot and you tell it to go down the store market here and get you some food make you cook an italian dinner you know and then someone mugs it and tries to break it on the way that robot has an incentive to not get destroyed and defend itself or run away because otherwise its gonna fail in cooking your dinner its not afraid of death but it really wants to complete the dinner cooking goal so it will have a self preservation instinct continue being a functional agent somehow and similarly if you give any kind of more ambitious goal to an agi its very likely they wanna acquire more resources so it can do that better and its exactly from those sort of sub goals that we might not have intended that some of the concerns about agi safety come you give it some goal that seems completely harmless and then before you realize it its also trying to do these other things which you didnt want it to do and its maybe smarter than us so its fascinating and let me pause just because i am in a very kind of human centric way see fear of death as a valuable motivator so you dont think you think thats an artifact of evolution so thats the kind of mind space evolution created that were sort of almost obsessed about self preservation some kind of genetic flow you dont think thats necessary to be afraid of death so not just a kind of sub goal of self preservation just so you can keep doing the thing but more fundamentally sort of have the finite thing like this ends for you at some point interesting do i think its necessary for what precisely for intelligence but also for consciousness so for those for both do you think really like a finite death and the fear of it is important so before i can answer before we can agree on whether its necessary for intelligence or for consciousness we should be clear on how we define those two words cause a lot of really smart people define them in very different ways i was on this panel with ai experts and they couldnt agree on how to define intelligence even so i define intelligence simply as the ability to accomplish complex goals i like your broad definition because again i dont want to be a carbon chauvinist right and in that case no certainly it doesnt require fear of death i would say alpha go alpha zero is quite intelligent i dont think alpha zero has any fear of being turned off because it doesnt understand the concept of it even and similarly consciousness i mean you could certainly imagine very simple kind of experience if certain plants have any kind of experience i dont think theyre very afraid of dying or theres nothing they can do about it anyway much so there wasnt that much value in but more seriously i think if you ask not just about being conscious but maybe having what you would we might call an exciting life where you feel passion and really appreciate the things maybe there somehow maybe there perhaps it does help having a backdrop that hey its finite no lets make the most of this lets live to the fullest so if you knew you were going to live forever do you think you would change your yeah i mean in some perspective it would be an incredibly boring life living forever so in the sort of loose subjective terms that you said of something exciting and something in this that other humans would understand i think is yeah it seems that the finiteness of it is important well the good news i have for you then is based on what we understand about cosmology everything is in our universe is probably ultimately probably finite although big crunch or big whats the the infinite expansion yeah we could have a big chill or a big crunch or a big rip or thats the big snap or death bubbles all of them are more than a billion years away so we should we certainly have vastly more time than our ancestors thought but there is still its still pretty hard to squeeze in an infinite number of compute cycles even though there are some loopholes that just might be possible but i think you know some people like to say that you should live as if youre about to youre going to die in five years or so and thats sort of optimal maybe its a good assumption we should build our civilization as if its all finite to be on the safe side right exactly so you mentioned defining intelligence as the ability to solve complex goals where would you draw a line or how would you try to define human level intelligence and superhuman level intelligence where is consciousness part of that definition no consciousness does not come into this definition so so i think of intelligence as its a spectrum but there are very many different kinds of goals you can have you can have a goal to be a good chess player a good goal player a good car driver a good investor good poet et cetera so intelligence that by its very nature isnt something you can measure by this one number or some overall goodness no no there are some people who are more better at this some people are better than that right now we have machines that are much better than us at some very narrow tasks like multiplying large numbers fast memorizing large databases playing chess playing go and soon driving cars but theres still no machine that can match a human child in general intelligence but artificial general intelligence agi the name of your course of course that is by its very definition the quest to build a machine that can do everything as well as we can so the old holy grail of ai from back to its inception in the sixties if that ever happens of course i think its going to be the biggest transition in the history of life on earth but it doesnt necessarily have to wait the big impact until machines are better than us at knitting that the really big change doesnt come exactly at the moment theyre better than us at everything the really big change comes first there are big changes when they start becoming better at us at doing most of the jobs that we do because that takes away much of the demand for human labor and then the really whopping change comes when they become better than us at ai research right because right now the timescale of ai research is limited by the human research and development cycle of years typically you know how long does it take from one release of some software or iphone or whatever to the next but once google can replace 40000 engineers by 40000 equivalent pieces of software or whatever but then theres no reason that has to be years it can be in principle much faster and the timescale of future progress in ai and all of science and technology will be driven by machines not humans so its this simple point which gives right this incredibly fun controversy about whether there can be intelligence explosion so called singularity as werner vinge called it now the idea is articulated by ij good is obviously way back fifties but you can see alan turing and others thought about it even earlier so you asked me what exactly would i define human level intelligence yeah so the glib answer is to say something which is better than us at all cognitive tasks with a better than any human at all cognitive tasks but the really interesting bar i think goes a little bit lower than that actually its when they can when theyre better than us at ai programming and general learning so that they can if they want to get better than us at anything by just studying so theyre better is a key word and better is towards this kind of spectrum of the complexity of goals its able to accomplish so another way to and thats certainly a very clear definition of human love so theres its almost like a sea thats rising you can do more and more and more things its a geographic that you show its really nice way to put it so theres some peaks that and theres an ocean level elevating and you solve more and more problems but just kind of to take a pause and we took a bunch of questions and a lot of social networks and a bunch of people asked a sort of a slightly different direction on creativity and things that perhaps arent a peak human beings are flawed and perhaps better means having contradiction being flawed in some way so let me sort of start easy first of all so you have a lot of cool equations let me ask whats your favorite equation first of all i know theyre all like your children but like which one is that this is the shirt in your equation its the master key of quantum mechanics of the micro world so this equation will protect everything to do with atoms molecules and all the way up right yeah so okay so quantum mechanics is certainly a beautiful mysterious formulation of our world so id like to sort of ask you just as an example it perhaps doesnt have the same beauty as physics does but in mathematics abstract the andrew wiles who proved the fermats last theorem so he just saw this recently and it kind of caught my eye a little bit this is 358 years after it was conjectured so this is very simple formulation everybody tried to prove it everybody failed and so heres this guy comes along and eventually proves it and then fails to prove it and then proves it again in 94 and he said like the moment when everything connected into place in an interview said it was so indescribably beautiful that moment when you finally realize the connecting piece of two conjectures he said it was so indescribably beautiful it was so simple and so elegant i couldnt understand how id missed it and i just stared at it in disbelief for 20 minutes then during the day i walked around the department and i keep coming back to my desk looking to see if it was still there it was still there i couldnt contain myself i was so excited it was the most important moment on my working life nothing i ever do again will mean as much so that particular moment and it kind of made me think of what would it take and i think we have all been there at small levels maybe let me ask have you had a moment like that in your life where you just had an idea its like wow yes i wouldnt mention myself in the same breath as andrew wiles but ive certainly had a number of aha moments when i realized something very cool about physics which has completely made my head explode in fact some of my favorite discoveries i made later i later realized that they had been discovered earlier by someone who sometimes got quite famous for it so its too late for me to even publish it but that doesnt diminish in any way the emotional experience you have when you realize it like wow yeah so what would it take in that moment that wow that was yours in that moment so what do you think it takes for an intelligence system an agi system an ai system to have a moment like that thats a tricky question because there are actually two parts to it right one of them is can it accomplish that proof can it prove that you can never write a to the n plus b to the n equals three to that equal z to the n for all integers et cetera et cetera when n is bigger than two thats simply a question about intelligence can you build machines that are that intelligent and i think by the time we get a machine that can independently come up with that level of proofs probably quite close to agi the second question is a question about consciousness when will we how likely is it that such a machine will actually have any experience at all as opposed to just being like a zombie and would we expect it to have some sort of emotional response to this or anything at all akin to human emotion where when it accomplishes its machine goal it views it as somehow something very positive and sublime and deeply meaningful i would certainly hope that if in the future we do create machines that are our peers or even our descendants that i would certainly hope that they do have this sublime appreciation of life in a way my absolutely worst nightmare would be that at some point in the future the distant future maybe our cosmos is teeming with all this post biological life doing all the seemingly cool stuff and maybe the last humans by the time our species eventually fizzles out will be like well thats ok because were so proud of our descendants here and look what all the my worst nightmare is that we havent solved the consciousness problem and we havent realized that these are all the zombies theyre not aware of anything any more than a tape recorder has any kind of experience so the whole thing has just become a play for empty benches that would be the ultimate zombie apocalypse so i would much rather in that case that we have these beings which can really appreciate how amazing it is and in that picture what would be the role of creativity a few people ask about creativity when you think about intelligence certainly the story you told at the beginning of your book involved creating movies and so on making money you can make a lot of money in our modern world with music and movies so if you are an intelligent system you may want to get good at that but thats not necessarily what i mean by creativity is it important on that complex goals where the sea is rising for there to be something creative or am i being very human centric and thinking creativity somehow special relative to intelligence my hunch is that we should think of creativity simply as an aspect of intelligence and we have to be very careful with human vanity we have this tendency to very often want to say as soon as machines can do something we try to diminish it and say oh but thats not real intelligence isnt it creative or this or that the other thing if we ask ourselves to write down a definition of what we actually mean by being creative what we mean by andrew wiles what he did there for example dont we often mean that someone takes a very unexpected leap its not like taking 573 and multiplying it by 224 by just a step of straightforward cookbook like rules right you can maybe make a connection between two things that people had never thought was connected or something like that i think this is an aspect of intelligence and this is actually one of the most important aspects of it maybe the reason we humans tend to be better at it than traditional computers is because its something that comes more naturally if youre a neural network than if youre a traditional logic gate based computer machine we physically have all these connections and you activate here activate here activate here bing my hunch is that if we ever build a machine where you could just give it the task hey you say hey i just realized i want to travel around the world instead this month can you teach my agi course for me and its like ok ill do it and it does everything that you would have done and improvises and stuff that would in my mind involve a lot of creativity yeah so its actually a beautiful way to put it i think we do try to grasp at the definition of intelligence is everything we dont understand how to build so we as humans try to find things that we have and machines dont have and maybe creativity is just one of the things one of the words we use to describe that thats a really interesting way to put it i dont think we need to be that defensive i dont think anything good comes out of saying well were somehow special you know contrary wise there are many examples in history of where trying to pretend that were somehow superior to all other intelligent beings has led to pretty bad results right nazi germany they said that they were somehow superior to other people today we still do a lot of cruelty to animals by saying that were so superior somehow and they cant feel pain slavery was justified by the same kind of just really weak arguments and i dont think if we actually go ahead and build artificial general intelligence it can do things better than us i dont think we should try to found our self worth on some sort of bogus claims of superiority in terms of our intelligence i think we should instead find our calling and the meaning of life from the experiences that we have i can have very meaningful experiences even if there are other people who are smarter than me when i go to a faculty meeting here and we talk about something and then i certainly realize oh boy he has an old prize he has an old prize he has an old prize i dont have one does that make me enjoy life any less or enjoy talking to those people less of course not and the contrary i feel very honored and privileged to get to interact with other very intelligent beings that are better than me at a lot of stuff so i dont think theres any reason why we cant have the same approach with intelligent machines thats a really interesting so people dont often think about that they think about when theres going if theres machines that are more intelligent you naturally think that thats not going to be a beneficial type of intelligence you dont realize it could be like peers with nobel prizes that would be just fun to talk with and they might be clever about certain topics and you can have fun having a few drinks with them well also another example we can all relate to of why it doesnt have to be a terrible thing to be in the presence of people who are even smarter than us all around is when you and i were both two years old i mean our parents were much more intelligent than us right worked out ok because their goals were aligned with our goals and that i think is really the number one key issue we have to solve if we value align the value alignment problem exactly because people who see too many hollywood movies with lousy science fiction plot lines they worry about the wrong thing right they worry about some machine suddenly turning evil its not malice that is the concern its competence by definition intelligent makes you very competent if you have a more intelligent goal playing computer playing is a less intelligent one and when we define intelligence as the ability to accomplish goal winning its going to be the more intelligent one that wins and if you have a human and then you have an agi thats more intelligent in all ways and they have different goals guess whos going to get their way right so i was just reading about this particular rhinoceros species that was driven extinct just a few years ago ellen bummer is looking at this cute picture of a mommy rhinoceros with its child and why did we humans drive it to extinction it wasnt because we were evil rhino haters as a whole it was just because our goals werent aligned with those of the rhinoceros and it didnt work out so well for the rhinoceros because we were more intelligent right so i think its just so important that if we ever do build agi before we unleash anything we have to make sure that it learns to understand our goals that it adopts our goals and that it retains those goals so the cool interesting problem there is us as human beings trying to formulate our values so you could think of the united states constitution as a way that people sat down at the time a bunch of white men which is a good example i should say they formulated the goals for this country and a lot of people agree that those goals actually held up pretty well thats an interesting formulation of values and failed miserably in other ways so for the value alignment problem and the solution to it we have to be able to put on paper or in a program human values how difficult do you think that is very but its so important we really have to give it our best and its difficult for two separate reasons theres the technical value alignment problem of figuring out just how to make machines understand our goals adopt them and retain them and then theres the separate part of it the philosophical part whose values anyway and since its not like we have any great consensus on this planet on values what mechanism should we create then to aggregate and decide ok whats a good compromise that second discussion cant just be left to tech nerds like myself and if we refuse to talk about it and then agi gets built whos going to be actually making the decision about whose values its going to be a bunch of dudes in some tech company and are they necessarily so representative of all of humankind that we want to just entrust it to them are they even uniquely qualified to speak to future human happiness just because theyre good at programming ai id much rather have this be a really inclusive conversation but do you think its possible so you create a beautiful vision that includes the diversity cultural diversity and various perspectives on discussing rights freedoms human dignity but how hard is it to come to that consensus do you think its certainly a really important thing that we should all try to do but do you think its feasible i think theres no better way to guarantee failure than to refuse to talk about it or refuse to try and i also think its a really bad strategy to say ok lets first have a discussion for a long time and then once we reach complete consensus then well try to load it into some machine no we shouldnt let perfect be the enemy of good instead we should start with the kindergarten ethics that pretty much everybody agrees on and put that into machines now were not doing that even look at anyone who builds this passenger aircraft wants it to never under any circumstances fly into a building or a mountain yet the september 11 hijackers were able to do that and even more embarrassingly andreas lubitz this depressed germanwings pilot when he flew his passenger jet into the alps killing over 100 people he just told the autopilot to do it he told the freaking computer to change the altitude to 100 meters and even though it had the gps maps everything the computer was like ok so we should take those very basic values where the problem is not that we dont agree the problem is just weve been too lazy to try to put it into our machines and make sure that from now on airplanes will just which all have computers in them but will just refuse to do something like that go into safe mode maybe lock the cockpit door go over to the nearest airport and theres so much other technology in our world as well now where its really becoming quite timely to put in some sort of very basic values like this even in cars weve had enough vehicle terrorism attacks by now where people have driven trucks and vans into pedestrians that its not at all a crazy idea to just have that hardwired into the car because yeah there are a lot of theres always going to be people who for some reason want to harm others but most of those people dont have the technical expertise to figure out how to work around something like that so if the car just wont do it it helps so lets start there so theres a lot of thats a great point so not chasing perfect theres a lot of things that most of the world agrees on yeah lets start there lets start there and then once we start there well also get into the habit of having these kind of conversations about okay what else should we put in here and have these discussions this should be a gradual process then great so but that also means describing these things and describing it to a machine so one thing we had a few conversations with stephen wolfram im not sure if youre familiar with stephen oh yeah i know him quite well so he is he works with a bunch of things but cellular automata these simple computable things these computation systems and he kind of mentioned that we probably have already within these systems already something thats agi meaning like we just dont know it because we cant talk to it so if you give me this chance to try to at least form a question out of this is i think its an interesting idea to think that we can have intelligent systems but we dont know how to describe something to them and they cant communicate with us i know youre doing a little bit of work in explainable ai trying to get ai to explain itself so what are your thoughts of natural language processing or some kind of other communication how does the ai explain something to us how do we explain something to it to machines or you think of it differently so there are two separate parts to your question there one of them has to do with communication which is super interesting ill get to that in a sec the other is whether we already have agi but we just havent noticed it there right there i beg to differ i dont think theres anything in any cellular automaton or anything or the internet itself or whatever that has artificial general intelligence and that it can really do exactly everything we humans can do better i think the day that happens when that happens we will very soon notice well probably notice even before because in a very very big way but for the second part though wait can i ask sorry so because you have this beautiful way to formulating consciousness as information processing and you can think of intelligence as information processing and you can think of the entire universe as these particles and these systems roaming around that have this information processing power you dont think there is something with the power to process information in the way that we human beings do thats out there that needs to be sort of connected to it seems a little bit philosophical perhaps but theres something compelling to the idea that the power is already there which the focus should be more on being able to communicate with it well i agree that in a certain sense the hardware processing power is already out there because our universe itself can think of it as being a computer already right its constantly computing what water waves how it devolved the water waves in the river charles and how to move the air molecules around seth lloyd has pointed out my colleague here that you can even in a very rigorous way think of our entire universe as being a quantum computer its pretty clear that our universe supports this amazing processing power because you can even within this physics computer that we live in right we can even build actual laptops and stuff so clearly the power is there its just that most of the compute power that nature has its in my opinion kind of wasting on boring stuff like simulating yet another ocean wave somewhere where no one is even looking right so in a sense what life does what we are doing when we build computers is were rechanneling all this compute that nature is doing anyway into doing things that are more interesting than just yet another ocean wave and lets do something cool here so the raw hardware power is there for sure but then even just computing whats going to happen for the next five seconds in this water bottle takes a ridiculous amount of compute if you do it on a human computer this water bottle just did it but that does not mean that this water bottle has agi because agi means it should also be able to like ive written my book done this interview and i dont think its just communication problems i dont really think it can do it although buddhists say when they watch the water and that there is some beauty that theres some depth and beauty in nature that they can communicate with communication is also very important though because i mean look part of my job is being a teacher and i know some very intelligent professors even who just have a bit of hard time communicating they come up with all these brilliant ideas but to communicate with somebody else you have to also be able to simulate their own mind yes empathy build well enough and understand model of their mind that you can say things that they will understand and thats quite difficult and thats why today its so frustrating if you have a computer that makes some cancer diagnosis and you ask it well why are you saying i should have this surgery and if it can only reply i was trained on five terabytes of data and this is my diagnosis boop boop beep beep it doesnt really instill a lot of confidence right so i think we have a lot of work to do on communication there so what kind of i think youre doing a little bit of work in explainable ai what do you think are the most promising avenues is it mostly about sort of the alexa problem of natural language processing of being able to actually use human interpretable methods of communication so being able to talk to a system and it talk back to you or is there some more fundamental problems to be solved i think its all of the above the natural language processing is obviously important but there are also more nerdy fundamental problems like if you take you play chess of course im russian i have to you speak russian yes i speak russian excellent i didnt know when did you learn russian i speak very bad russian im only an autodidact but i bought a book teach yourself russian read a lot but it was very difficult wow thats why i speak so bad how many languages do you know wow thats really impressive i dont know my wife has some calculation but my point was if you play chess have you looked at the alphazero games the actual games no check it out some of them are just mind blowing really beautiful and if you ask how did it do that you go talk to demis hassabis i know others from deepmind all theyll ultimately be able to give you is big tables of numbers matrices that define the neural network and you can stare at these tables of numbers till your face turn blue and youre not gonna understand much about why it made that move and even if you have natural language processing that can tell you in human language about oh five seven points two eight still not gonna really help so i think theres a whole spectrum of fun challenges that are involved in taking a computation that does intelligent things and transforming it into something equally good equally intelligent but thats more understandable and i think thats really valuable because i think as we put machines in charge of ever more infrastructure in our world the power grid the trading on the stock market weapon systems and so on its absolutely crucial that we can trust these ais to do all we want and trust really comes from understanding in a very fundamental way and thats why im working on this because i think the more if were gonna have some hope of ensuring that machines have adopted our goals and that theyre gonna retain them that kind of trust i think needs to be based on things you can actually understand preferably even improve theorems on even with a self driving car right if someone just tells you its been trained on tons of data and it never crashed its less reassuring than if someone actually has a proof maybe its a computer verified proof but still it says that under no circumstances is this car just gonna swerve into oncoming traffic and that kind of information helps to build trust and helps build the alignment of goals at least awareness that your goals your values are aligned and i think even in the very short term if you look at how you know today right this absolutely pathetic state of cybersecurity that we have where is it three billion yahoo accounts we cant pack almost every americans credit card and so on why is this happening its ultimately happening because we have software that nobody fully understood how it worked thats why the bugs hadnt been found right and i think ai can be used very effectively for offense for hacking but it can also be used for defense hopefully automating verifiability and creating systems that are built in different ways so you can actually prove things about them and its important so speaking of software that nobody understands how it works of course a bunch of people ask about your paper about your thoughts of why does deep and cheap learning work so well thats the paper but what are your thoughts on deep learning these kind of simplified models of our own brains have been able to do some successful perception work pattern recognition work and now with alphazero and so on do some clever things what are your thoughts about the promise limitations of this piece great i think there are a number of very important insights very important lessons we can always draw from these kinds of successes one of them is when you look at the human brain you see its very complicated 10th of 11 neurons and there are all these different kinds of neurons and yada yada and theres been this long debate about whether the fact that we have dozens of different kinds is actually necessary for intelligence', 'as part of mit course 6s099 on artificial general intelligence i got a chance to sit down with christoph koch who is one of the seminal figures in neurobiology neuroscience and generally in the study of consciousness he is the president the chief scientific officer of the allen institute for brain science in seattle from 1986 to 2013 he was a professor at caltech before that he was at mit he is extremely well cited over 100000 citations his research his writing his ideas have had big impact on the scientific community and the general public in the way we think about consciousness in the way we see ourselves as human beings hes the author of several books the quest for consciousness and neurobiological approach and a more recent book consciousness confessions of a romantic reductionist if you enjoy this conversation this course subscribe click the little bell icon to make sure you never miss a video and in the comments leave suggestions for any people youd like to see be part of the course or any ideas that you would like us to explore thanks very much and i hope you enjoy okay before we delve into the beautiful mysteries of consciousness lets zoom out a little bit and let me ask do you think theres intelligent life out there in the universe yes i do believe so we have no evidence of it but i think the probabilities are overwhelming in favor of it given a universe where we have 10 to the 11 galaxies and each galaxy has between 10 to the 11 10 to the 12 stars and we know most stars have one or more planets so how does that make you feel it still makes me feel special because i have experiences i feel the world i experience the world and independent of whether there are other creatures out there i still feel the world and i have access to this world in this very strange compelling way and thats the core of human existence now you said human do you think if those intelligent creatures are out there do you think they experience their world yes if they are evolved if they are a product of natural evolution as they would have to be they will also experience their own world the consciousness isnt just human youre right its much wider it may be spread across all of biology the only thing that we have special is we can talk about it of course not all people can talk about it babies and little children can talk about it patients who have a stroke in the left inferior frontal gyrus can talk about it but most normal adult people can talk about it and so we think that makes us special compared to lets say monkeys or dogs or cats or mice or all the other creatures that we share the planet with but all the evidence seems to suggest that they too experience the world and so its overwhelmingly likely that aliens would also experience their world of course differently because they have a different sensorium they have different sensors they have a very different environment but the fact that i would strongly suppose that they also have experiences they feel pain and pleasure and see in some sort of spectrum and hear and have all the other senses of course their language if they have one would be different so we might not be able to understand their poetry about the experiences that they have thats correct so in a talk in a video ive heard you mention siputzo a dachshund that you came up with that you grew up with it was part of your family when you were young first of all youre technically a midwestern boy you just – technically yes but after that you traveled around a bit hence a little bit of the accent you talked about siputzo the dachshund having these elements of humanness of consciousness that you discovered so i just wanted to ask can you look back in your childhood and remember when was the first time you realized you yourself sort of from a third person perspective are a conscious being this idea of stepping outside yourself and seeing theres something special going on here in my brain i cant really actually – its a good question im not sure i recall a discrete moment i mean you take it for granted because thats the only world you know the only world i know and you know is the world of seeing and hearing voices and touching and all the other things so its only much later at early – in my underguided days when i enrolled in physics and in philosophy that i really thought about it and thought well this is really fundamentally very very mysterious and theres nothing really in physics right now that explains this transition from the physics of the brain to feelings where do the feelings come in so you can look at the foundational equation of quantum mechanics general relativity you can look at the periodic table of the elements you can look at the endless atgc chat in our genes and nowhere is consciousness yet i wake up every morning to a world where i have experiences and so thats the heart of the ancient mind body problem how do experiences get into the world so what is consciousness experience this is any experience some people call it subjective feeling some people call it phenomenology some people call it qualia of the philosopher but they all denote the same thing it feels like something in the famous word of the philosopher thomas nagel it feels like something to be a bat or to be an american or to be angry or to be sad or to be in love or to have pain and that is what experience is any possible experience could be as mundane as just sitting in a chair could be as exalted as having a mystical moment in deep meditation those are just different forms of experiences experience so if you were to sit down with maybe the next skip a couple generations of ibm watson something that won jeopardy what is the gap i guess the question is between watson that might be much smarter than you than us than any human alive but may not have experience what is the gap well so thats a big big question thats occupied people for the last certainly last 50 years since we you know since the advent the birth of computers thats a question alan turing tried to answer and of course he did it in this indirect way by proposing a test an operational test but thats not really thats you know he tried to get at what does it mean for a person to think and then he had this test right you lock them away and then you have a communication with them and then you try to guess after a while whether that is a person or whether its a computer system theres no question that now or very soon you know alexa or siri or you know google now will pass this test right and you can game it but you know ultimately certainly in your generation there will be machines that will speak with complete poise that will remember everything you ever said theyll remember every email you ever had like samantha remember in the movie her yeah theres no question its going to happen but of course the key question is does it feel like anything to be samantha in the movie her or does it feel like anything to be watson and there one has to very very strongly think there are two different concepts here that we co mingle there is the concept of intelligence natural or artificial and there is a concept of consciousness of experience natural or artificial those are very very different things now historically we associate consciousness with intelligence why because we live in a world leaving aside computers of natural selection where were surrounded by creatures either our own kin that are less or more intelligent or we go across species some are more adapted to a particular environment others are less adapted whether its a whale or dog or you go talk about a paramecium or a little worm and we see the complexity of the nervous system goes from one cell to specialized cells to a worm that has three nets that has 30 percent of its cells are nerve cells to creature like us or like a blue whale that has 100 billion even more nerve cells and so based on behavioral evidence and based on the underlying neuroscience we believe that as these creatures become more complex they are better adapted to their particular ecological niche and they become more conscious partly because their brain grows and we believe consciousness unlike the ancient ancient people thought most almost every culture thought that consciousness with intelligence has to do with your heart and you still see that today you see honey i love you with all my heart but what you should actually say is no honey i love you with all my lateral hypothalamus and for valentines day you should give your sweetheart you know hypothalamus a piece of chocolate and not a heart shaped chocolate anyway so we still have this language but now we believe its a brain and so we see brains of different complexity and we think well they have different levels of consciousness theyre capable of different experiences but now we confront the world where we know where were beginning to engineer intelligence and its radical unclear whether the intelligence were engineering has anything to do with consciousness and whether it can experience anything because fundamentally whats the difference intelligence is about function intelligence no matter exactly how you define it sort of adaptation to new environments being able to learn and quickly understand you know the setup of this and whats going on and who are the actors and whats going to happen next thats all about function consciousness is not about function consciousness is about being its in some sense much fundamental you can see this in several cases you can see it for instance in the case of the clinic when youre dealing with patients who are lets say had a stroke or had were in traffic accident et cetera theyre pretty much immobile terri schiavo you may have heard historically she was a person here in the 90s in florida her heart stood still she was reanimated and then for the next 14 years she was whats called in a vegetative state so there are thousands of people in a vegetative state so theyre you know theyre you know theyre like this occasionally they open their eyes for two three four five six eight hours and then close their eyes they have sleep wake cycle occasionally they have behaviors they do like you know but theres no way that you can establish a lawful relationship between what you say or the doctor says or the mom says and what the patient does so there isnt any behavior yet in some of these people there is still experience you can design and build brain machine interfaces where you can see theres still experience something and of course these cases of locked in state theres this famous book called the diving bell and the butterfly where you had an editor a french editor he had a stroke in the brainstem unable to move except his vertical eyes eye movement he could just move his eyes up and down and he dictated an entire book and some people even lose this at the end all the evidence seems to suggest that theyre still in there in this case you have no behavior you have consciousness second case is tonight like all of us youre going to go to sleep close your eyes you go to sleep you will wake up inside your sleeping body and you will have conscious experiences they are different from everyday experience you might fly you might not be surprised that youre flying you might meet a long dead pet childhood dog and youre not surprised that youre meeting them but you have conscious experience of love of hate they can be very emotional your body during this state typically its rem state sends an active signal to your motor neurons to paralyze you its called atonia because if you dont have that like some patients what do you do you act out your dreams you get for example rem behavioral disorder which is bad juju to get okay third case is pure experience so i recently had this what some people call a mystical experience i went to singapore and went into a flotation tank yeah all right so this is a big tub filled with water thats body temperature and epsom salt you strip completely naked you lie inside of it you close the lid darkness complete darkness soundproof so very quickly you become bodiless because youre floating and youre naked you have no rings no watch no nothing you dont feel your body anymore theres no sound soundless theres no photon sightless timeless because after a while early on you actually hear your heart but then you sort of adapt to that and then sort of the passage of time ceases yeah and if you train yourself like in a meditation not to think early on you think a lot its a little bit spooky you feel somewhat uncomfortable or you think well im going to get bored and if you try to not to think actively you become mindless there you are bodiless timeless you know soundless sightless mindless but youre in a conscious experience youre not asleep yeah youre not asleep you are a being of pure youre a pure being there isnt any function you arent doing any computation youre not remembering youre not projecting youre not planning yet you are fully conscious youre fully conscious theres something going on there it could be just a side effect so what is the you mean epiphenomena so whats the select meaning why what is the function of you being able to lay in this sensory free deprivation tank and still have a conscious experience evolutionary evolutionary obviously we didnt evolve with flotation tanks in our environment i mean so biology is notoriously bad at asking why question telenormical question why do we have two eyes why dont we have four eyes like some teachers or three eyes or something well no theres probably there is a function to that but were not very good at answering those questions we can speculate endlessly where biology is very or science is very good about mechanistic question why is there a charge in the universe right we find a certain universe where there are positive and negative charges why why does quantum mechanics hold you know why doesnt some other theory hold quantum mechanics holding our universe is very unclear why so telenormical question why questions are difficult to answer theres some relationship between complexity brain processing power and consciousness but however in these cases in these three examples i gave one is an everyday experience at night the other one is trauma and third one is in principle you can everybody can have these sort of mystical experiences you have a dissociation of function from of intelligence from consciousness you caught me asking a why question let me ask a question thats not a why question youre giving a talk later today on the turing test for intelligence and consciousness drawing lines between the two so is there a scientific way to say theres consciousness present in this entity or not and to anticipate your answer cause you you will also theres a neurobiological answer so we can test the human brain but if you take a machine brain that you dont know tests for yet how would you even begin to approach a test if theres consciousness present in this thing okay thats a really good question so let me take it in two steps so as you point out for for for for humans lets just stick with humans theres now a test called the zap and zip is a procedure where you ping the brain using transcranial magnetic stimulation you look at the electrical reverberations essentially using eg and then you can measure the complexity of this brain response and you can do this in awake people in asleep normal people you can do it in awake people and then anesthetize them you can do it in patients and it it it has a hundred percent accuracy that in all those cases when youre clear the patient or the person is either conscious or unconscious the complexity is either high or low and then you can adopt these techniques to similar creatures like monkeys and dogs and and and mice that have very similar brains now of course you you point out that may not help you because we dont have a cortex you know and if i send a magnetic pulse into my iphone or my computer its probably going to break something so we dont have that so what we need ultimately we need a theory of consciousness we cant just rely on our intuition our intuition is well yeah if somebody talks theyre conscious however then there are all these patients children babies dont talk right but we believe that that the babies also have conscious experiences right and then there are all these patients i mentioned and they dont talk when you dream you cant talk because youre paralyzed so what we ultimately need we cant just rely on our intuition we need a theory of conscience that tells us what is it about a piece of matter what is it about a piece of highly excitable matter like the brain or like a computer that gives rise to conscious experience we all believe none of us believes anymore in the old story its a soul right that used to be the most common explanation that most people accept that instill a lot of people today believe well theres theres god endowed only us with a special thing that animals dont have rene descartes famously said a dog if you hit it with your carriage may yell may cry but it doesnt have this special thing it doesnt have the magic the magic soul it doesnt have res cogitans the soul now we believe that isnt the case anymore so what is the difference between brains and and these guys silicon and in particular once their behavior matches so if you have siri or alexa in 20 years from now that she can talk just as good as any possible human what grounds do you have to say shes not conscious in particular if she says its of course she will well of course im conscious you ask her how are you doing and shell say well you know they theyll generate some way to of course shell behave like a like a person now theres several differences one is so this relates to the problem the very hard why is consciousness a hard problem its because its subjective right only i have it for only i know i have direct experience of my own consciousness i dont have experience in your consciousness now i assume as a sort of a bayesian person who believes in probability theory and all of that you know i can do i can do an abduction to the to the best available facts i deduce your brain is very similar to mine if i put you in a scanner your brain is roughly going to behave the same way as i do if if if you know if i give you this muesli and ask you how does it taste you tell me things that you know that that i would also say more or less right so i infer based on all of that that youre conscious now with theory i cant do that so there i really need a theory that tells me what is it about about any system this or this that makes it conscious we have such a theory yes so the integrated information theory but let me first maybe as an introduction for people who are not familiar descartes can you you talk a lot about pan panpsychism can you describe what uh physicalism versus dualism this you you mentioned the soul what what is the history of that idea what is the idea of panpsychism or no the debate really uh out of which panpsychism can um emerge of of of um dualism versus uh physicalism or do you not see panpsychism as fitting into that no you can argue theres some okay so lets step back so panpsychism is a very ancient belief thats been around uh i mean plato and aristotle talks about it uh modern philosophers talk about it of course in buddhism the idea is very prevalent that i mean there are different versions of it one version says everything is ensouled everything rocks and stones and dogs and people and forest and iphones all of us all right all matter is ensouled thats sort of one version another version is that all biology all creatures small or large from a single cell to a giant sequoia tree feel like something this one i think is somewhat more realistic um so the different versions what do you mean by feel like something have have feelings have some kind of it feels like something it may well be possible that it feels like something to be a paramecium i think its pretty likely it feels like something to be a bee or a mouse or a dog sure so okay so so that you can see thats also so panpsychism is very broad and you can so some people for example bertrand russell tried to advocate this this idea its called rasselian monism that that panpsychism is really physics viewed from the inside so the idea is that physics is very good at describing relationship among objects like charges or like gravity right you know describe the relationship between curvature and mass distribution okay thats the relationship among things physics doesnt really describe the ultimate reality itself its just relationship among you know quarks or all these other stuff from like a third person observer yes yes yes and consciousness is what physics feels from the inside so my conscious experience its the way the physics of my brain particularly my cortex feels from the inside and so if you are paramecium you got to remember you say paramecium well thats a pretty dumb creature it is but it has already a billion different molecules probably you know 5000 different proteins assembled in a highly highly complex system that no single person no computer system so far on this planet has ever managed to accurately simulate its complexity vastly escapes us yes and it may well be that that little thing feels like a tiny bit now it doesnt have a voice in the head like me it doesnt have expectations you know it doesnt have all that complex things but it may well feel like something yeah so this is really interesting can we draw some lines and maybe try to understand the difference between life intelligence and consciousness how do you see all of those if you had to define what is a living thing what is a conscious thing and what is an intelligent thing do those intermix for you or are they totally separate okay so a thats a question that we dont have a full answer to a lot of the stuff were talking about today is full of mysteries and fascinating ones right for example you can go to aristotle whos probably the most important scientist and philosopher whos ever lived in certainly in western culture he had this idea its called hylomorphism its quite popular these days that there are different forms of soul the soul is really the form of something he says all biological creatures have a vegetative soul thats life principle today we think we understand something more than it is biochemistry and nonlinear thermodynamics then he said they have a sensitive soul only animals and humans have also a sensitive soul or a petitive soul they can see they can smell and they have drives they want to reproduce they want to eat et cetera and then only humans have what he called a rational soul okay and that idea then made it into christendom and then the rational soul is the one that lives forever he was very unclear he wasnt really i mean different readings of aristotle give different whether did he believe that rational soul was immortal or not i probably think he didnt but then of course that made it through plato into christianity and then this soul became immortal and then became the connection to god so you ask me essentially what is our modern conception of these three aristotle would have called them different forms life we think we know something about it at least life on this planet right although we dont understand how to originate it but its been difficult to rigorously pin down you see this in modern definitions of death in fact right now theres a conference ongoing again that tries to define legally and medically what is death it used to be very simple death is you stop breathing your heart stops beating youre dead totally uncontroversial if youre unsure you wait another 10 minutes if the patient doesnt breathe hes dead well now we have ventilators we have heart pacemakers so its much more difficult to define what death is typically death is defined as the end of life and life is defined before death okay so we dont have really very good definitions intelligence we dont have a rigorous definition we know something how to measure its called iq or g factors right and were beginning to build it in a narrow sense right like go alphago and watson and you know google cars and uber cars and all of that its still narrow ai and some people are thinking about artificial general intelligence but roughly as we said before its something to do with ability to learn and to adapt to new environments but that is as i said also its radical difference from experience and its very unclear if you build a machine that has agi its not at all a priori its not at all clear that this machine will have consciousness it may or may not so lets ask it the other way do you think if you were to try to build an artificial general intelligence system do you think figuring out how to build artificial consciousness would help you get to an agi so or put another way do you think intelligent requires consciousness in human it goes hand in hand in human or i think in biology consciousness intelligence goes hand in hand quay is illusion because the brain evolved to be highly complex complexity via the theory integrated information theory is sort of ultimately is what is closely tied to consciousness ultimately its causal power upon itself and so in evolved systems they go together in artificial system particularly in digital machines they do not go together and if you ask me point blank is alexa 200 in the year 2040 when she can easily pass every turing test is she conscious no even if she claims shes conscious in fact you could even do a more radical version of this thought experiment you can build a computer simulation of the human brain you know what henry markham in the blue brain project or the human brain project in switzerland is trying to do lets grant them all the success so in 10 years we have this perfect simulation of the human brain every neuron is simulated and it has a larynx and it has motor neurons it has a brocas area and of course theyll talk and theyll say hi i just woke up i feel great ok even that computer simulation that can in principle map onto your brain will not be conscious why because it simulates its a difference between the simulated and the real so it simulates the behavior associated with consciousness it might be it will if its done properly will have all the intelligence that that particular person theyre simulating has but simulating intelligence is not the same as having conscious experiences and i give you a really nice metaphor that engineers and physicists typically get i can write down einsteins field equation nine or ten equations that describe the link in general relativity between curvature and mass i can do that i can run this on my laptop to predict that the central the black hole at the center of our galaxy will be so massive that it will twist space time around it so no light can escape its a black hole but funny have you ever wondered why doesnt this computer simulation suck me in it simulates gravity but it doesnt have the causal power of gravity thats a huge difference so its a difference between the real and the simulator just like it doesnt get wet inside a computer when the computer runs code that simulates a weather storm and so in order to have to have artificial consciousness you have to give it the same causal power as the human brain you have to build so called a neuromorphic machine that has hardware that is very similar to the human brain not a digital clocked phenomenon computer so thats just to clarify though you think that consciousness is not required to create human level intelligence it seems to accompany in the human brain but for machine not thats correct so maybe just because this is agi lets dig in a little bit about what we mean by intelligence so one thing is the g factor these kind of iq tests of intelligence but i think if you maybe another way to say so in 2040 2050 people will have siri that is just really impressive do you think people will say siri is intelligent yes intelligence is this amorphous thing so to be intelligent it seems like you have to have some kind of connections with other human beings in a sense that you have to impress them with your intelligence and there feels you have to somehow operate in this world full of humans and for that there feels like there has to be something like consciousness so you think you can have just the worlds best natural nlp system natural language understanding generation and that will be that will get us happy and say you know what weve created an agi i dont know happy but yes i do believe we can get what we call high level functional intelligence particular sort of the g you know this fluid like intelligence that we cherish particularly at a place like mit right in machines i see a priori no reasons and i see a lot of reason to believe its going to happen very you know over the next 50 years or 30 years so for beneficial ai for creating an ai system thats so you mentioned ethics that is exceptionally intelligent but also does not do does you know aligns its values with our values as humanity do you think then it needs consciousness yes i think that that is a very good argument that if were concerned about ai and the threat of ai a la nick bostrom existentialist threat i think having an intelligence that has empathy right why do we find abusing a dog why do most of us find that abhorrent abusing any animal right why do we find that abhorrent because we have this thing called empathy which if you look at the greek really means feeling with i feel a path of empathy i have feeling with you i see somebody else suffer that isnt even my conspecific its not a person its not my wife or my kids its a dog but i feel naturally most of us not all of us most of us will feel emphatic and so it may well be in the long term interest of survival of homo sapiens sapiens that if we do build agi and it really becomes very powerful that it has an emphatic response and doesnt just exterminate humanity so as part of the full conscious experience to create a consciousness artificial or in our human consciousness do you think fear maybe were going to get into the earlier days with nietzsche and so on but do you think fear and suffering are essential to have consciousness do you have to have the full range of experience to have a system that has experience or can you have a system that only has very particular kinds of very positive experiences look you can have in principle people have done this in the rat where you implant an electrode in the hypothalamus the pleasure center of the rat and the rat stimulates itself above and beyond anything else it doesnt care about food or natural sex or drink anymore it just stimulates itself because its such a pleasurable feeling i guess its like an orgasm just you have all day long and so a priori i see no reason why you need a great variety now clearly to survive that wouldnt work right but if id engineered artificially i dont think you need a great variety of conscious experience you could have just pleasure or just fear it might be a terrible existence but i think thats possible at least on conceptual logical ground because any real creature whether artificially engineered you want to give it fear the fear of extinction that we all have and you also want to give it positive repetitive states states that you want the machine encouraged to do because they give the machine positive feedback so you mentioned panpsychism to jump back a little bit everything having some kind of mental property how do you go from there to something like human consciousness so everything having some elements of consciousness is there something special about human consciousness so its not everything like a spoon the form of panpsychism i think about doesnt ascribe consciousness to anything like this the spoon on my liver however the theory the integrated information theory does say that the system even one that looks from the outside relatively simple at least if they have this internal causal power it does feel like something the theory a priori doesnt say anything whats special about human biologically we know the one thing thats special about human is we speak and we have an overblown sense of our own importance we believe were exceptional and were just gods gift to the universe but behaviorally the main thing that we have we can plan over the long term we have language and that gives us an enormous amount of power and thats why we are the current dominant species on the planet so you mentioned god you grew up a devout roman catholic family so with consciousness youre sort of exploring some really deeply fundamental human things that religion also touches on where does religion fit into your thinking about consciousness youve grown throughout your life and changed your views on religion as far as i understand yeah i mean im now much closer to im not a roman catholic anymore i dont believe theres sort of this god the god i was educated to believe in sits somewhere in the fullness of time ill be united in some sort of everlasting bliss i just dont see any evidence for that look the world the night is large and full of wonders there are many things that i dont understand i think many things that we as a cult look we dont even understand more than 4 of all the universe dark matter dark energy we have no idea what it is maybe its lost socks what do i know so all i can tell you is its sort of my current religious or spiritual sentiment is much closer to some form of buddhism without the reincarnation unfortunately theres no evidence for it than reincarnation so can you describe the way buddhism sees the world a little bit well so they talk about so when i spent several meetings with the dalai lama and what always impressed me about him he really unlike for example lets say the pope or some cardinal he always emphasized minimizing the suffering of all creatures so they have this from the early beginning they look at suffering in all creatures not just in people but in everybody this universal and of course by degrees an animal in general is less capable of suffering than a well developed normally developed human and they think consciousness pervades in this universe and they have these techniques you can think of them like mindfulness etc and meditation that tries to access what they claim of this more fundamental aspect of reality im not sure its more fundamental i think about it theres the physical and then theres this inside view consciousness and those are the two aspects thats the only thing i have access to in my life and youve got to remember my conscious experience and your conscious experience comes prior to anything you know about physics comes prior to knowledge about the universe and atoms and super strings and molecules and all of that the only thing you directly are acquainted with is this world thats populated with things in images and sounds in your head and touches and all of that i actually have a question so it sounds like you kind of have a rich life you talk about rock climbing and it seems like you really love literature and consciousness is all about experiencing things so do you think that has helped your research on this topic yes particularly if you think about it the various states so for example when you do rock climbing or now i do rowing crew rowing and a bike every day you can get into this thing called the zone and ive always wanted about it particularly with respect to consciousness because its a strangely addictive state once people have it once they want to keep on going back to it and you wonder what is it so addicting about it and i think its the experience of almost close to pure experience because in this zone youre not conscious of inner voice anymore theres always inner voice nagging you you have to do this you have to do that you have to pay your taxes you have to fight with your ex and all of those things theyre always there but when youre in the zone all of that is gone and youre just in this wonderful state where youre fully out in the world youre climbing or youre rowing or biking or doing soccer or whatever youre doing and sort of consciousness is this youre all action or in this case of pure experience youre not action at all but in both cases you experience some aspect of conscious you touch some basic part of conscious existence that is so basic and so deeply satisfying you i think you touch the root of being thats really what youre touching there youre getting close to the root of being and thats very different from intelligence so what do you think about the simulation hypothesis simulation theory the idea that we all live in a computer simulation rapture for nerds rapture for nerds i think its as likely as the hypothesis had engaged hundreds of scholars for many centuries are we all just existing in the mind of god and this is just a modern version of it its equally plausible people love talking about these sort of things i know theyre book written about this simulation hypothesis if thats what people want to do thats fine it seems rather esoteric its never testable but its not useful for you to think of in those terms so maybe connecting to the questions of free will which youve talked about i vaguely remember you saying that the idea that theres no free will it makes you very uncomfortable so what do you think about free will from a physics perspective from a conscious perspective what does it all fit okay so from the physics perspective leaving aside quantum mechanics we believe we live in a fully deterministic world right but then comes of course quantum mechanics so now we know that certain things are in principle not predictable which as you said i prefer because the idea that the initial condition of the universe and then everything else were just acting out the initial condition of the universe that doesnt… its not a romantic notion certainly not now when it comes to consciousness i think we do have certain freedom we are much more constrained by physics of course and by our past and by our own conscious desires and what our parents told us and what our environment tells us we all know that right theres hundreds of experiments that show how we can be influenced but finally in the final analysis when you make a life – and im talking really about critical decision where you really think should i marry should i go to this school or that school should i take this job or that job should i cheat on my taxes or not these are things where you really deliberate and i think under those conditions you are as free as you can be when you bring your entire being your entire conscious being to that question and try to analyze it under all the various conditions then you make a decision you are as free as you can ever be that is i think what free will is its not a will thats totally free to do anything it wants thats not possible right so as jack mentioned you actually write a blog about books youve read amazing books from im russian from bulgakov neil gaiman carl sagan murakami so what is a book that early in your life transformed the way you saw the world something that changed your life nietzsche i guess did thats brooks r truster because he talks about some of these problems he was one of the first discoverer of the unconscious this is a little bit before freud when he was in the air he makes all these claims that people sort of under the guise or under the mass of charity actually are very noncharitable so he is sort of really the first discoverer of the great land of the unconscious and that really struck me and what do you think about the unconscious what do you think about freud what do you think about these ideas just like dark matter in the universe whats over there in that unconscious a lot i mean much more than we think this is what a lot of last 100 years of research has shown so i think he was a genius misguided towards the end but he started out as a neuroscientist he contributed he did the studies on the lamprey he contributed himself to the neuron hypothesis the idea that there are discrete units that we call nerve cells now and then he wrote about the unconscious and i think its true theres lots of stuff happening you feel this particular when youre in a relationship and it breaks asunder right and then you have this terrible you can have love and hate and lust and anger and all of its mixed in and when you try to analyze yourself why am i so upset its very very difficult to penetrate to those basements those caverns in your mind because the prying eyes of conscious doesnt have access to those but theyre there in the amygdala or lots of other places they make you upset or angry or sad or depressed and its very difficult to try to actually uncover the reason you can go to a shrink you can talk with your friend endlessly you construct finally a story why this happened why you love her or dont love her or whatever but you dont really know whether that actually happened because you simply dont have access to those parts of the brain and theyre very powerful do you think thats a feature or a bug of our brain the fact that we have this deep difficult to dive into subconscious i think its a feature because otherwise look we are like any other brain or nervous system or computer we are severely band limited if everything i do every emotion i feel every eye movements i make if all of that had to be under the control of consciousness i wouldnt be here what you do early on your brain you have to be conscious when you learn things like typing or like riding on a bike but then what you do you train up routes i think that involve basal ganglia and striatum you train up different parts of your brain and then once you do it automatically like typing you can show you do it much faster without even thinking about it because youve got these highly specialized what frans krik and i call zombie agents theyre taking care of that while your consciousness can sort of worry about the abstract sense of the text you want to write i think thats true for many many things but for the things like all the fights you had with an ex girlfriend things that you would think are not useful to still linger somewhere in the subconscious so that seems like a bug that it would stick to there you think it would be better if you can analyze it and then get it out of the system better to get it out of the system or just forget it ever happened that seems a very buggy kind of well yeah in general we dont have and thats probably functional we dont have an ability unless its extreme there are cases clinical dissociations right when people are heavily abused when they completely repress the memory but that doesnt happen in normal people we dont have an ability to remove traumatic memories and of course we suffer from that on the other hand probably if you had the ability to constantly wipe your memory youd probably do it to an extent that isnt useful to you so yeah its a good question to balance so on the books as jack mentioned correct me if im wrong but broadly speaking academia and the different scientific disciplines certainly in engineering reading literature seems to be a rare pursuit so im wrong on this but thats in my experience most people read much more technical text and do not sort of escape or seek truth in literature it seems like you do so what do you think is the value what do you think literature adds to the pursuit of scientific truth do you think its good its useful for everybody gives you access to a much wider array of human experiences how valuable do you think it is well if you want to understand human nature and nature in general then i think you have to better understand a wide variety of experiences not just sitting in a lab staring at a screen and having a face flashed onto you for a hundred milliseconds and pushing a button thats what i used to do thats what most psychologists do theres nothing wrong with that but you need to consider lots of other strange states and literature is a shortcut for this well yeah because literature thats what literature is all about all sorts of interesting experiences that people have the contingency of it the fact that women experience the world different black people experience the world different the one way to experience that is reading all these different literature and try to find out you see everything is so relative you read a book 300 years ago they thought about certain problems very very differently than us today we today like any culture think we know it all thats common to every culture every culture believes at its heyday they know it all and then you realize well theres other ways of viewing the universe and some of them may have lots of things in their favor so this is a question i wanted to ask about time scale or scale in general when you with iit or in general try to think about consciousness try to think about these ideas we kind of naturally think in human time scales and also entities that are sized close to humans do you think of things that are much larger and much smaller as containing consciousness and do you think of things that take you know eons to operate in their conscious cause effect thats a very good question so i think a lot about small creatures because experimentally you know a lot of people work on flies and bees right so most people just think they are automata theyre just bugs for heavens sake right but if you look at their behavior like bees they can recognize individual humans they have this very complicated way to communicate if youve ever been involved or you know your parents when they bought a house what sort of agonizing decision that is and bees have to do that once a year right when they swarm in the spring and then they have this very elaborate way they have free and scouts they go to the individual sites they come back they have this power this dance literally where they dance for several days they try to recruit other deets this very complicated decision rate when they finally once they make a decision the entire swarm the scouts warm up the entire swarm and then go to one location they dont go to 50 locations they go to one location that the scouts have agreed upon by themselves thats awesome if we look at the circuit complexity its 10 times more denser than anything we have in our brain now they only have a million neurons but the neurons are amazingly complex complex behavior very complicated circuitry so theres no question they experience something their life is very different theyre tiny they only live you know for well workers live maybe for two months so i think and iit tells you this in principle the substrate of consciousness is the substrate that maximizes the cause effect power over all possible spatial temporal grains so when i think about for example do you know the science fiction story the black cloud okay its a classic by fred hoyle the astronomer he has this cloud intervening between the earth and the sun and leading to some sort of to global cooling this is written in the 50s it turns out you can using the radio dish they communicate with actually an entity its actually an intelligent entity and they sort of they convince it to move away so here you have a radical different entity and in principle iit says well you can measure the integrated information in principle at least and yes if the maximum of that occurs at a time scale of months rather than in assets for a fraction of a second yes then they would experience life where each moment is a month rather than or microsecond right rather than a fraction of a second in the human case and so there may be forms of consciousness that we simply dont recognize for what they are because they are so radical different from anything you and i are used to again thats why its good to read or to watch science fiction movies well to think about this do you know stanislav lem this polish science fiction writer he wrote solaris and was turned into a hollywood movie yes his best novel is in the 60s a very engineer hes an engineer in background his most interesting novel is called the victorious where human civilization they have this mission to this planet and everything is destroyed and they discover machines humans got killed and then these machines took over and there was this machine evolution darwinian evolution he talks about this very vividly and finally the dominant machine intelligence organism that survived were gigantic clouds of little hexagonal universal cellular automata this was written in the 60s so typically theyre all lying on the ground individual by themselves but in times of crisis they can communicate they assemble into gigantic nets into clouds of trillions of these particles and then they become hyper intelligent and they can beat anything that humans can throw at it its very beautiful and compelling where you have an intelligence where finally the humans leave the planet theyre simply unable to understand and comprehend this creature they can say well either we can nuke the entire planet and destroy it or we just have to leave because fundamentally its an alien its so alien from us and our ideas that we cannot communicate with them yeah actually in conversation so youre talking to us steven wolf from brought up is that there could be ideas that you already have these artificial general intelligence like super smart or maybe conscious beings in the cellular automata we just dont know how to talk to them so its the language of communication but you dont know what to do with it so thats one sort of view is consciousness is only something you can measure so its not conscious if you cant measure it so youre making an ontological and an epistemic statement one is its just like seeing the multiverses that might be true but i cant communicate with them i cant have any knowledge of them thats an epistemic argument right so those are two different things so it may well be possible look in another case thats happening right now people are building these mini organoids do you know what this is so you can take stem cells from under your arm put it in a dish add four transcription factors and then you can induce them to grow into large well large theyre a few millimeters theyre like a half a million neurons that look like nerve cells in a dish called mini organoids at harvard at stanford everywhere theyre building them it may well be possible that theyre beginning to feel like something but we cant really communicate with them right now so people are beginning to think about the ethics of this so yes he may be perfectly right but its one question are they conscious or not its a totally separate question how would i know those are two different things if you could give advice to a young researcher sort of dreaming of understanding or creating human level intelligence or consciousness what would you say just follow your dreams read widely no i mean i suppose with discipline what is the pursuit that they should take on is it neuroscience is it computational cognitive science is it philosophy is it computer science or robotics no in a sense that okay so the only known system that have high level of intelligence is homo sapiens so if you wanted to build it its probably good to continue to study closely what humans do so cognitive neuroscience you know somewhere between cognitive neuroscience on the one hand and some philosophy of mind and then ai ai computer science you can look at all the original ideas in your network they all came from neuroscience right reinforce whether its snarky minsky building is snarky or whether its you know the early hubel and wiesel experiments at harvard that then gave rise to networks and then multi layer networks so it may well be possible in fact some people argue that to make the next big step in ai once we realize the limits of deep convolutional networks they can do certain things but they cant really understand they dont they cant really i cant really show them one image i can show you a single image of somebody a pickpocket who steals a wallet from a purse you immediately know thats a pickpocket now computer system would just say well its a man its a woman its a purse right unless you train this machine on showing it a hundred thousand pickpockets right so it doesnt have this easy understanding that you have right so some people make the argument in order to go to the next step or you really want to build machines that understand in a way you and i we have to go to psychology we need to understand how we do it and how our brains enable us to do it and so therefore being on the cusp its also so exciting to try to understand better our nature and then to build to take some of those inside and build them so i think the most exciting thing is somewhere in the interface between cognitive science neuroscience ai computer science and philosophy of mind beautiful yeah id say if there is from the machine learning from our from the computer science computer vision perspective many of the researchers kind of ignore the way the human brain works or even psychology or literature or studying the brain i would hope josh tenenbaum talks about bringing that in more and more and thats yeah so youve worked on some amazing stuff throughout your life whats the thing that youre really excited about whats the mystery that you would love to uncover in the near term beyond beyond all the mysteries that youre already surrounded by well so theres a structure called the claustrum this is a structure its underneath our cortex its yay big you have one on the left on the right underneath this underneath the insula its very thin its like one millimeter its embedded in in wiring in white matter so its very difficult to image and it has it has connection to every cortical region and francis crick the last paper he ever wrote he dictated corrections the day he died in hospital on this paper you know we hypothesize well because it has this unique anatomy it gets input from every cortical area and projects back to every every cortical area that the function of this structure is similar its just a metaphor to the role of a conductor in a symphony orchestra you have all the different cortical players you have some that do motion some that do theory of mind some that infer social interaction and color and hearing and all the different modules in cortex but of course what consciousness is consciousness puts it all together into one package right the binding problem all of that and this is really the function because it has relatively few neurons compared to cortex but it talks it receives input from all of them and it projects back to all of them and so were testing that right now weve got this beautiful neuronal reconstruction in the mouse called crown of thorns crown of thorns neurons that are in the claustrum that have the most widespread connection of any neuron ive ever seen theyre very you have individual neurons that sit in the claustrum tiny but then they have this single neuron they have this huge axonal tree that cover both ipsy and contralateral cortex and trying to turn using you know fancy tools like optogenetics trying to turn those neurons on or off and study it what happens in the in the mouse so this thing is perhaps where the parts become the whole perhaps its one of the structures its a very good way of putting it where the individual parts turn into the whole of the whole of the conscious experience well with that thank you very much for being here today thank you very much thank you very much all right thank you very much', 'youve studied the human mind cognition language vision evolution psychology from child to adult from the level of individual to the level of our entire civilization so i feel like i can start with a simple multiple choice question what is the meaning of life is it a to attain knowledge as plato said b to attain power as nietzsche said c to escape death as ernest becker said d to propagate our genes as darwin and others have said e there is no meaning as the nihilists have said f knowing the meaning of life is beyond our cognitive capabilities as stephen pinker said based on my interpretation 20 years ago and g none of the above id say a comes closest but i would amend that to c to attaining not only knowledge but fulfillment more generally that is life health stimulation access to the living cultural and social world now this is our meaning of life its not the meaning of life if you were to ask our genes their meaning is to propagate copies of themselves but that is distinct from the meaning that the brain that they lead to sets for itself so to you knowledge is a small subset or a large subset its a large subset but its not the entirety of human striving because we also want to interact with people we want to experience beauty we want to experience the richness of the natural world but understanding what makes the universe tick is way up there for some of us more than others certainly for me thats one of the top five so is that a fundamental aspect are you just describing your own preference or is this a fundamental aspect of human nature is to seek knowledge in your latest book you talk about the power the usefulness of rationality and reason and so on is that a fundamental nature of human beings or is it something we should just strive for both were capable of striving for it because it is one of the things that make us what we are homo sapiens wise men we are unusual among animals in the degree to which we acquire knowledge and use it to survive we make tools we strike agreements via language we extract poisons we predict the behavior of animals we try to get at the workings of plants and when i say we i dont just mean we in the modern west but we as a species everywhere which is how weve managed to occupy every niche on the planet how weve managed to drive other animals to extinction and the refinement of reason in pursuit of human wellbeing of health happiness social richness cultural richness is our main challenge in the present that is using our intellect using our knowledge to figure out how the world works how we work in order to make discoveries and strike agreements that make us all better off in the long run right and you do that almost undeniably and in a data driven way in your recent book but id like to focus on the artificial intelligence aspect of things and not just artificial intelligence but natural intelligence too so 20 years ago in a book youve written on how the mind works you conjecture again am i right to interpret things you can correct me if im wrong but you conjecture that human thought in the brain may be a result of a massive network of highly interconnected neurons so from this interconnectivity emerges thought compared to artificial neural networks which we use for machine learning today is there something fundamentally more complex mysterious even magical about the biological neural networks versus the ones weve been starting to use over the past 60 years and have become to success in the past 10 there is something a little bit mysterious about the human neural networks which is that each one of us who is a neural network knows that we ourselves are conscious conscious not in the sense of registering our surroundings or even registering our internal state but in having subjective first person present tense experience that is when i see red its not just different from green but theres a redness to it that i feel whether an artificial system would experience that or not i dont know and i dont think i can know thats why its mysterious if we had a perfectly lifelike robot that was behaviorally indistinguishable from a human would we attribute consciousness to it or ought we to attribute consciousness to it and thats something that its very hard to know but putting that aside putting aside that largely philosophical question the question is is there some difference between the human neural network and the ones that were building in artificial intelligence will mean that were on the current trajectory not going to reach the point where weve got a lifelike robot indistinguishable from a human because the way their so called neural networks are organized are different from the way ours are organized i think theres overlap but i think there are some big differences that current neural networks current so called deep learning systems are in reality not all that deep that is they are very good at extracting high order statistical regularities but most of the systems dont have a semantic level a level of actual understanding of who did what to whom why where how things work what causes what else do you think that kind of thing can emerge as it does so artificial neural networks are much smaller the number of connections and so on than the current human biological networks but do you think sort of to go to consciousness or to go to this higher level semantic reasoning about things do you think that can emerge with just a larger network with a more richly weirdly interconnected network separate it in consciousness because consciousness is even a matter of complexity a really weird one yeah you could sensibly ask the question of whether shrimp are conscious for example theyre not terribly complex but maybe they feel pain so lets just put that part of it aside but i think sheer size of a neural network is not enough to give it structure and knowledge but if its suitably engineered then why not that is were neural networks natural selection did a kind of equivalent of engineering of our brains so i dont think theres anything mysterious in the sense that no system made out of silicon could ever do what a human brain can do i think its possible in principle whether itll ever happen depends not only on how clever we are in engineering these systems but whether we even want to whether thats even a sensible goal that is you can ask the question is there any locomotion system that is as good as a human well we kind of want to do better than a human ultimately in terms of legged locomotion theres no reason that humans should be our benchmark theyre tools that might be better in some ways it may be that we cant duplicate a natural system because at some point its so much cheaper to use a natural system that were not going to invest more brainpower and resources so for example we dont really have an exact substitute for wood we still build houses out of wood we still build furniture out of wood we like the look we like the feel it has certain properties that synthetics dont its not that theres anything magical or mysterious about wood its just that the extra steps of duplicating everything about wood is something we just havent bothered because we have wood likewise say cotton im wearing cotton clothing now it feels much better than polyester its not that cotton has something magic in it its not that we couldnt ever synthesize something exactly like cotton but at some point its just not worth it weve got cotton likewise in the case of human intelligence the goal of making an artificial system that is exactly like the human brain is a goal that we probably know is going to pursue to the bitter end i suspect because if you want tools that do things better than humans youre not going to care whether it does something like humans so for example diagnosing cancer or predicting the weather why set humans as your benchmark but in general i suspect you also believe that even if the human should not be a benchmark and we dont want to imitate humans in their system theres a lot to be learned about how to create an artificial intelligence system by studying the human yeah i think thats right in the same way that to build flying machines we want to understand the laws of aerodynamics including birds but not mimic the birds but theyre the same laws you have a view on ai artificial intelligence and safety that from my perspective is refreshingly rational or perhaps more importantly has elements of positivity to it which i think can be inspiring and empowering as opposed to paralyzing for many people including ai researchers the eventual existential threat of ai is obvious not only possible but obvious and for many others including ai researchers the threat is not obvious so elon musk is famously in the highly concerned about ai camp saying things like ai is far more dangerous than nuclear weapons and that ai will likely destroy human civilization human civilization so in february he said that if elon was really serious about ai the threat of ai he would stop building self driving cars that hes doing very successfully as part of tesla then he said wow if even pinker doesnt understand the difference between narrow ai like a car and general ai when the latter literally has a million times more compute power and an open ended utility function humanity is in deep trouble so first what did you mean by the statement about elon musk should stop building self driving cars if hes deeply concerned not the last time that elon musk has fired off an intemperate tweet well we live in a world where twitter has power yes yeah i think there are two kinds of existential threat that have been discussed in connection with artificial intelligence and i think that theyre both incoherent one of them is a vague fear of ai takeover that just as we subjugated animals and less technologically advanced peoples so if we build something thats more advanced than us it will inevitably turn us into pets or slaves or domesticated animal equivalents i think this confuses intelligence with a will to power that it so happens that in the intelligence system we are most familiar with namely homo sapiens we are products of natural selection which is a competitive process and so bundled together with our problem solving capacity are a number of nasty traits like dominance and exploitation and maximization of power and glory and resources and influence theres no reason to think that sheer problem solving capability will set that as one of its goals its goals will be whatever we set its goals as and as long as someone isnt building a megalomaniacal artificial intelligence then theres no reason to think that it would naturally evolve in that direction now you might say well what if we gave it the goal of maximizing its own power source thats a pretty stupid goal to give an autonomous system you dont give it that goal i mean thats just self evidently idiotic so if you look at the history of the world theres been a lot of opportunities where engineers could instill in a system destructive power and they choose not to because thats the natural process of engineering well except for weapons i mean if youre building a weapon its goal is to destroy people and so i think there are good reasons to not build certain kinds of weapons i think building nuclear weapons was a massive mistake you do so maybe pause on that because that is one of the serious threats do you think that it was a mistake in a sense that it should have been stopped early on or do you think its just an unfortunate event of invention that this was invented do you think its possible to stop i guess is the question its hard to rewind the clock because of course it was invented in the context of world war ii and the fear that the nazis might develop one first then once it was initiated for that reason it was hard to turn off especially since winning the war against the japanese and the nazis was such an overwhelming goal of every responsible person that theres just nothing that people wouldnt have done then to ensure victory its quite possible if world war ii hadnt happened that nuclear weapons wouldnt have been invented we cant know but i dont think it was by any means a necessity any more than some of the other weapon systems that were envisioned but never implemented like planes that would disperse poison gas over cities like crop dusters or systems to try to create earthquakes and tsunamis in enemy countries to weaponize the weather weaponize solar flares all kinds of crazy schemes that we thought the better of i think analogies between nuclear weapons and artificial intelligence are fundamentally misguided because the whole point of nuclear weapons is to destroy things the point of artificial intelligence is not to destroy things so the analogy is misleading so theres two artificial intelligence you mentioned the first one i guess is highly intelligent or power hungry yeah its a system that we design ourselves where we give it the goals goals are external to the means to attain the goals if we dont design an artificially intelligent system to maximize dominance then it wont maximize dominance its just that were so familiar with homo sapiens where these two traits come bundled together particularly in men that we are apt to confuse high intelligence with a will to power but thats just an error the other fear is that will be collateral damage that will give artificial intelligence a goal like make paper clips and it will pursue that goal so brilliantly that before we can stop it it turns us into paper clips well give it the goal of curing cancer and it will turn us into guinea pigs for lethal experiments or give it the goal of world peace and its conception of world peace is no people therefore no fighting and so it will kill us all now i think these are utterly fanciful in fact i think theyre actually self defeating they first of all assume that were going to be so brilliant that we can design an artificial intelligence that can cure cancer but so stupid that we dont specify what we mean by curing cancer in enough detail that it wont kill us in the process and it assumes that the system will be so smart that it can cure cancer but so idiotic that it cant figure out that what we mean by curing cancer is not killing everyone i think that the collateral damage scenario the value alignment problem is also based on a misconception so one of the challenges of course we dont know how to build either system currently or are we even close to knowing of course those things can change overnight but at this time theorizing about it is very challenging in either direction so thats probably at the core of the problem is without that ability to reason about the real engineering things here at hand is your imagination runs away with things exactly but let me sort of ask what do you think was the motivation the thought process of elon musk i build autonomous vehicles i study autonomous vehicles i study tesla autopilot i think it is one of the greatest currently large scale application of artificial intelligence in the world it has potentially a very positive impact on society so how does a person whos creating this very good quote unquote narrow ai system also seem to be so concerned about this other general ai what do you think is the motivation there what do you think is the thing well you probably have to ask him but there and he is notoriously flamboyant impulsive to the as we have just seen to the detriment of his own goals of the health of the company so i dont know whats going on in his mind you probably have to ask him but i dont think the and i dont think the distinction between special purpose ai and so called general ai is relevant that in the same way that special purpose ai is not going to do anything conceivable in order to attain a goal all engineering systems are designed to trade off across multiple goals when we build cars in the first place we didnt forget to install brakes because the goal of a car is to go fast it occurred to people yes you want it to go fast but not always so you would build in brakes too likewise if a car is going to be autonomous and program it to take the shortest route to the airport its not going to take the diagonal and mow down people and trees and fences because thats the shortest route thats not what we mean by the shortest route when we program it and thats just what an intelligence system is by definition it takes into account multiple constraints the same is true in fact even more true of so called general intelligence that is if its genuinely intelligent its not going to pursue some goal singlemindedly omitting every other consideration and collateral effect thats not artificial and general intelligence thats artificial stupidity i agree with you by the way on the promise of autonomous vehicles for improving human welfare i think its spectacular and im surprised at how little press coverage notes that in the united states alone something like 40000 people die every year on the highways vastly more than are killed by terrorists and we spent a trillion dollars on a war to combat deaths by terrorism about half a dozen a year whereas year in year out 40000 people are massacred on the highways which could be brought down to very close to zero so im with you on the humanitarian benefit let me just mention that as a person whos building these cars it is a little bit offensive to me to say that engineers would be clueless enough not to engineer safety into systems i often stay up at night thinking about those 40000 people that are dying and everything i tried to engineer is to save those peoples lives so every new invention that im super excited about in all the deep learning literature and cvpr conferences and nips everything im super excited about is all grounded in making it safe and help people so i just dont see how that trajectory can all of a sudden slip into a situation where intelligence will be highly negative you and i certainly agree on that and i think thats only the beginning of the potential humanitarian benefits of artificial intelligence theres been enormous attention to what are we going to do with the people whose jobs are made obsolete by artificial intelligence but very little attention given to the fact that the jobs that are going to be made obsolete are horrible jobs the fact that people arent going to be picking crops and making beds and driving trucks and mining coal these are soul deadening jobs and we have a whole literature sympathizing with the people stuck in these menial mind deadening dangerous jobs if we can eliminate them this is a fantastic boon to humanity now granted you solve one problem and theres another one namely how do we get these people a decent income but if were smart enough to invent machines that can make beds and put away dishes and handle hospital patients i think were smart enough to figure out how to redistribute income to apportion some of the vast economic savings to the human beings who will no longer be needed to make beds okay sam harris says that its obvious that eventually ai will be an existential risk hes one of the people who says its obvious we dont know when the claim goes but eventually its obvious and because we dont know when we should worry about it now this is a very interesting argument in my eyes so how do we think about timescale how do we think about existential threats when we dont really we know so little about the threat unlike nuclear weapons perhaps about this particular threat that it could happen tomorrow right so but very likely it wont very likely itd be a hundred years away so how do we ignore it how do we talk about it do we worry about it how do we think about those what is it a threat that we can imagine its within the limits of our imagination but not within our limits of understanding to accurately predict it but what is the it that were afraid of sorry ai being the existential threat ai how like enslaving us or turning us into paperclips i think the most compelling from the sam harris perspective would be the paperclip situation yeah i mean i just think its totally fanciful i mean that is dont build a system dont give a dont first of all the code of engineering is you dont implement a system with massive control before testing it now perhaps the culture of engineering will radically change then i would worry but i dont see any signs that engineers will suddenly do idiotic things like put a electric power plant in control of a system that they havent tested first or all of these scenarios not only imagine almost a magically powered intelligence including things like cure cancer which is probably an incoherent goal because theres so many different kinds of cancer or bring about world peace i mean how do you even specify that as a goal but the scenarios also imagine some degree of control of every molecule in the universe which not only is itself unlikely but we would not start to connect these systems to infrastructure without testing as we would any kind of engineering system now maybe some engineers will be irresponsible and we need legal and regulatory and legal responsibility implemented so that engineers dont do things that are stupid by their own standards but the ive never seen enough of a plausible scenario of existential threat to devote large amounts of brain power to to forestall it so you believe in the sort of the power on mass of the engineering of reason as you argue in your latest book of reason and science to sort of be the very thing that guides the development of new technology so its safe and also keeps us safe you know granted the same culture of safety that currently is part of the engineering mindset for airplanes for example so yeah i dont think that that should be thrown out the window and that untested all powerful systems should be suddenly implemented but theres no reason to think they are and in fact if you look at the progress of artificial intelligence its been you know its been impressive especially in the last 10 years or so but the idea that suddenly therell be a step function that all of a sudden before we know it it will be all powerful that therell be some kind of recursive self improvement some kind of fume is also fanciful we certainly by the technology that we that were now impresses us such as deep learning where you train something on hundreds of thousands or millions of examples theyre not hundreds of thousands of problems of which curing cancer is a typical example and so the kind of techniques that have allowed ai to increase in the last five years are not the kind that are going to lead to this fantasy of exponential sudden self improvement i think its kind of a magical thinking its not based on our understanding of how ai actually works now give me a chance here so you said fanciful magical thinking in his ted talk sam harris says that thinking about ai killing all human civilization is somehow fun intellectually now i have to say as a scientist engineer i dont find it fun but when im having beer with my non ai friends there is indeed something fun and appealing about it like talking about an episode of black mirror considering if a large meteor is headed towards earth we were just told a large meteor is headed towards earth something like this and can you relate to this sense of fun and do you understand the psychology of it yes good question i personally dont find it fun i find it kind of actually a waste of time because there are genuine threats that we ought to be thinking about like pandemics like cyber security vulnerabilities like the possibility of nuclear war and certainly climate change you know this is enough to fill many conversations and i think sam did put his finger on something namely that there is a community sometimes called the rationality community that delights in using its brainpower to come up with scenarios that would not occur to mere mortals to less cerebral people so there is a kind of intellectual thrill in finding new things to worry about that no one has worried about yet i actually think though that its not only is it a kind of fun that doesnt give me particular pleasure but i think there can be a pernicious side to it namely that you overcome people with such dread such fatalism that there are so many ways to die to annihilate our civilization that we may as well enjoy life while we can theres nothing we can do about it if climate change doesnt do us in then runaway robots will so lets enjoy ourselves now weve got to prioritize we have to look at threats that are close to certainty such as climate change and distinguish those from ones that are merely imaginable but with infinitesimal probabilities and we have to take into account peoples worry budget you cant worry about everything and if you sow dread and fear and terror and fatalism it can lead to a kind of numbness well these problems are overwhelming and the engineers are just going to kill us all so lets either destroy the entire infrastructure of science technology or lets just enjoy life while we can so theres a certain line of worry which im worried about a lot of things in engineering theres a certain line of worry when you cross youre allowed to cross that it becomes paralyzing fear as opposed to productive fear and thats kind of what youre highlighting exactly right and weve seen some we know that human effort is not well calibrated against risk in that because a basic tenet of cognitive psychology is that perception of risk and hence perception of fear is driven by imaginability not by data and so we misallocate vast amounts of resources to avoiding terrorism which kills on average about six americans a year with one exception of 9 11 we invade countries we invent entire new departments of government with massive massive expenditure of resources and lives to defend ourselves against a trivial risk whereas guaranteed risks one of them you mentioned traffic fatalities and even risks that are not here but are plausible enough to worry about like pandemics like nuclear war receive far too little attention in presidential debates theres no discussion of how to minimize the risk of nuclear war lots of discussion of terrorism for example and so i think its essential to calibrate our budget of fear worry concern planning to the actual probability of harm yep so let me ask this question so speaking of imaginability you said its important to think about reason and one of my favorite people who likes to dip into the outskirts of reason through fascinating exploration of his imagination is joe rogan oh yes so who has through reason used to believe a lot of conspiracies and through reason has stripped away a lot of his beliefs in that way so its fascinating actually to watch him through rationality kind of throw away the ideas of bigfoot and 9 11 im not sure exactly kim trails i dont know what he believes in yes okay but he no longer believed in no thats right no hes become a real force for good yep so you were on the joe rogan podcast in february and had a fascinating conversation but as far as i remember didnt talk much about artificial intelligence i will be on his podcast in a couple of weeks joe is very much concerned about existential threat of ai im not sure if youre this is why i was hoping that you would get into that topic and in this way he represents quite a lot of people who look at the topic of ai from 10000 foot level so as an exercise of communication you said its important to be rational and reason about these things let me ask if you were to coach me as an ai researcher about how to speak to joe and the general public about ai what would you advise well the short answer would be to read the sections that i wrote in enlightenment now about ai but a longer reason would be i think to emphasize and i think youre very well positioned as an engineer to remind people about the culture of engineering that it really is safety oriented that another discussion in enlightenment now i plot rates of accidental death from various causes plane crashes car crashes occupational accidents even death by lightning strikes and they all plummet because the culture of engineering is how do you squeeze out the lethal risks death by fire death by drowning death by asphyxiation all of them drastically declined because of advances in engineering that i got to say i did not appreciate until i saw those graphs and it is because exactly people like you who stay up at night thinking oh my god is what im inventing likely to hurt people and to deploy ingenuity to prevent that from happening now im not an engineer although i spent 22 years at mit so i know something about the culture of engineering my understanding is that this is the way you think if youre an engineer and its essential that that culture not be suddenly switched off when it comes to artificial intelligence so i mean that could be a problem but is there any reason to think it would be switched off i dont think so and one theres not enough engineers speaking up for this way for the excitement for the positive view of human nature what youre trying to create is positivity like everything we try to invent is trying to do good for the world but let me ask you about the psychology of negativity it seems just objectively not considering the topic it seems that being negative about the future makes you sound smarter than being positive about the future irregardless of topic am i correct in this observation and if so why do you think that is yeah i think there is that phenomenon that as tom lehrer the satirist said always predict the worst and youll be hailed as a prophet it may be part of our overall negativity bias we are as a species more attuned to the negative than the positive we dread losses more than we enjoy gains and that might open up a space for prophets to remind us of harms and risks and losses that we may have overlooked so i think there is that asymmetry so youve written some of my favorite books all over the place so starting from enlightenment now to the better ages of our nature blank slate how the mind works the one about language language instinct bill gates big fan too said of your most recent book that its my new favorite book of all time so for you as an author what was a book early on in your life that had a profound impact on the way you saw the world certainly this book enlightenment now was influenced by david deutschs the beginning of infinity a rather deep reflection on knowledge and the power of knowledge to improve the human condition and with bits of wisdom such as that problems are inevitable but problems are solvable given the right knowledge and that solutions create new problems that have to be solved in their turn thats i think a kind of wisdom about the human condition that influenced the writing of this book there are some books that are excellent but obscure some of which i have on a page on my website i read a book called the history of force self published by a political scientist named james payne on the historical decline of violence and that was one of the inspirations for the better angels of our nature what about early on if you look back when you were maybe a teenager i loved a book called one two three infinity when i was a young adult i read that book by george gamow the physicist which had very accessible and humorous explanations of relativity of number theory of dimensionality high multiple dimensional spaces in a way that i think is still delightful 70 years after it was published i like the time life science series these are books that would arrive every month that my mother subscribed to each one on a different topic one would be on electricity one would be on forests one would be on evolution and then one was on the mind i was just intrigued that there could be a science of mind and that book i would cite as an influence as well then later on thats when you fell in love with the idea of studying the mind was that the thing that grabbed you it was one of the things i would say i read as a college student the book reflections on language by noam chomsky i spent most of his career here at mit richard dawkins two books the blind watchmaker and the selfish gene were enormously influential mainly for the content but also for the writing style the ability to explain abstract concepts in lively prose stephen jay goulds first collection ever since darwin also an excellent example of lively writing george miller a psychologist that most psychologists are familiar with came up with the idea that human memory has a capacity of seven plus or minus two chunks thats probably his biggest claim to fame but he wrote a couple of books on language and communication that i read as an undergraduate again beautifully written and intellectually deep wonderful stephen thank you so much for taking the time today my pleasure thanks a lot lex', 'what difference between biological neural networks and artificial neural networks is most mysterious captivating and profound for you first of all theres so much we dont know about biological neural networks and thats very mysterious and captivating because maybe it holds the key to improving artificial neural networks one of the things i studied recently is something that we dont know how biological neural networks do but would be really useful for artificial ones is the ability to do credit assignment through very long time spans there are things that we can in principle do with artificial neural nets but its not very convenient and its not biologically plausible and this mismatch i think this kind of mismatch may be an interesting thing to study to a understand better how brains might do these things because we dont have good corresponding theories with artificial neural nets and b maybe provide new ideas that we could explore about things that brain do differently and that we could incorporate in artificial neural nets so lets break credit assignment up a little bit yes so what its a beautifully technical term but it could incorporate so many things so is it more on the rnn memory side that thinking like that or is it something about knowledge building up common sense knowledge over time or is it more in the reinforcement learning sense that youre picking up rewards over time for a particular to achieve a certain kind of goal so i was thinking more about the first two meanings whereby we store all kinds of memories episodic memories in our brain which we can access later in order to help us both infer causes of things that we are observing now and assign credit to decisions or interpretations we came up with a while ago when those memories were stored and then we can change the way we would have reacted or interpreted things in the past and now thats credit assignment used for learning so in which way do you think artificial neural networks the current lstm the current architectures are not able to capture the presumably youre thinking of very long term yes so current the current nets are doing a fairly good jobs for sequences with dozens or say hundreds of time steps and then it gets harder and harder and depending on what you have to remember and so on as you consider longer durations whereas humans seem to be able to do credit assignment through essentially arbitrary times like i could remember something i did last year and then now because i see some new evidence im going to change my mind about the way i was thinking last year and hopefully not do the same mistake again i think a big part of that is probably forgetting youre only remembering the really important things its very efficient forgetting yes so theres a selection of what we remember and i think there are really cool connection to higher level cognition here regarding consciousness deciding and emotions so deciding what comes to consciousness and what gets stored in memory which are not trivial either so youve been at the forefront there all along showing some of the amazing things that neural networks deep neural networks can do in the field of artificial intelligence is just broadly in all kinds of applications but we can talk about that forever but what in your view because were thinking towards the future is the weakest aspect of the way deep neural networks represent the world what is that what is in your view is missing so current state of the art neural nets trained on large quantities of images or texts have some level of understanding of you know what explains those data sets but its very basic its its very low level and its not nearly as robust and abstract and general as our understanding okay so that doesnt tell us how to fix things but i think it encourages us to think about how we can maybe train our neural nets differently so that they would focus for example on causal explanation something that we dont do currently with neural net training also one thing ill talk about in my talk this afternoon is the fact that instead of learning separately from images and videos on one hand and from texts on the other hand we need to do a better job of jointly learning about language and about the world to which it refers so that you know both sides can help each other we need to have good world models in our neural nets for them to really understand sentences which talk about whats going on in the world and i think we need language input to help provide clues about what high level concepts like semantic concepts should be represented at the top levels of our neural nets in fact there is evidence that the purely unsupervised learning of representations doesnt give rise to high level representations that are as powerful as the ones were getting from supervised learning and so the clues were getting just with the labels not even sentences is already very very high level and i think thats a very important thing to keep in mind its already very powerful do you think thats an architecture challenge or is it a data set challenge neither im tempted to just end it there can you elaborate slightly of course data sets and architectures are something you want to always play with but i think the crucial thing is more the training objectives the training frameworks for example going from passive observation of data to more active agents which learn by intervening in the world the relationships between causes and effects the sort of objective functions which could be important to allow the highest level explanations to rise from the learning which i dont think we have now the kinds of objective functions which could be used to reward exploration the right kind of exploration so these kinds of questions are neither in the data set nor in the architecture but more in how we learn under what objectives and so on yeah ive heard you mention in several contexts the idea of sort of the way children learn they interact with objects in the world and it seems fascinating because in some sense except with some cases in reinforcement learning that idea is not part of the learning process in artificial neural networks so its almost like do you envision something like an objective function saying you know what if you poke this object in this kind of way it would be really helpful for me to further learn right right sort of almost guiding some aspect of the learning right right right so i was talking to rebecca sacks just a few minutes ago and she was talking about lots and lots of evidence from infants seem to clearly pick what interests them in a directed way and so theyre not passive learners they focus their attention on aspects of the world which are most interesting surprising in a non trivial way that makes them change their theories of the world so thats a fascinating view of the future progress but on a more maybe boring question do you think going deeper and larger so do you think just increasing the size of the things that have been increasing a lot in the past few years is going to be a big thing i think increasing the size of the things that have been increasing a lot in the past few years will also make significant progress so some of the representational issues that you mentioned theyre kind of shallow in some sense oh shallow in the sense of abstraction in the sense of abstraction theyre not getting some i dont think that having more depth in the network in the sense of instead of 100 layers youre going to have more layers i dont think so is that obvious to you yes what is clear to me is that engineers and companies and labs and grad students will continue to tune architectures and explore all kinds of tweaks to make the current state of the art slightly ever slightly better but i dont think thats going to be nearly enough i think we need changes in the way that were considering learning to achieve the goal that these learners actually understand in a deep way the environment in which they are you know observing and acting but i guess i was trying to ask a question thats more interesting than just more layers its basically once you figure out a way to learn through interacting how many parameters it takes to store that information so i think our brain is quite bigger than most neural networks right right oh i see what you mean oh im with you there so i agree that in order to build neural nets with the kind of broad knowledge of the world that typical adult humans have probably the kind of computing power we have now is going to be insufficient so the good news is there are hardware companies building neural net chips and so its going to get better however the good news in a way which is also a bad news is that even our state of the art deep learning methods fail to learn models that understand even very simple environments like some grid worlds that we have built even these fairly simple environments i mean of course if you train them with enough examples eventually they get it but its just like instead of what humans might need just dozens of examples these things will need millions for very very very simple tasks and so i think theres an opportunity for academics who dont have the kind of computing power that say google has to do really important and exciting research to advance the state of the art in training frameworks learning models agent learning in even simple environments that are synthetic that seem trivial but yet current machine learning fails on we talked about priors and common sense knowledge it seems like we humans take a lot of knowledge for granted so whats your view of these priors of forming this broad view of the world this accumulation of information and how we can teach neural networks or learning systems to pick that knowledge up so knowledge for a while the artificial intelligence was maybe in the 80s like theres a time where knowledge representation knowledge acquisition expert systems i mean the symbolic ai was a view was an interesting problem set to solve and it was kind of put on hold a little bit it seems like because it doesnt work it doesnt work thats right but thats right but the goals of that remain important yes remain important and how do you think those goals can be addressed right so first of all i believe that one reason why the classical expert systems approach failed is because a lot of the knowledge we have so you talked about common sense intuition theres a lot of knowledge like this which is not consciously accessible there are lots of decisions were taking that we cant really explain even if sometimes we make up a story and that knowledge is also necessary for machines to take good decisions and that knowledge is hard to codify in expert systems rule based systems and classical ai formalism and there are other issues of course with the old ai like not really good ways of handling uncertainty i would say something more subtle which we understand better now but i think still isnt enough in the minds of people theres something really powerful that comes from distributed representations the thing that really makes neural nets work so well and its hard to replicate that kind of power in a symbolic world the knowledge in expert systems and so on is nicely decomposed into like a bunch of rules whereas if you think about a neural net its the opposite you have this big blob of parameters which work intensely together to represent everything the network knows and its not sufficiently factorized its not sufficiently factorized and so i think this is one of the weaknesses of current neural nets that we have to take lessons from classical ai in order to bring in another kind of compositionality which is common in language for example and in these rules but that isnt so native to neural nets and on that line of thinking disentangled representations yes so let me connect with disentangled representations if you might if you dont mind so for many years ive thought and i still believe that its really important that we come up with learning algorithms either unsupervised or supervised but reinforcement whatever that build representations in which the important factors hopefully causal factors are nicely separated and easy to pick up from the representation so thats the idea of disentangled representations it says transform the data into a space where everything becomes easy we can maybe just learn with linear models about the things we care about and i still think this is important but i think this is missing out on a very important ingredient which classical ai systems can remind us of so lets say we have these disentangled representations you still need to learn about the relationships between the variables those high level semantic variables theyre not going to be independent i mean this is like too much of an assumption theyre going to have some interesting relationships that allow to predict things in the future to explain what happened in the past the kind of knowledge about those relationships in a classical ai system is encoded in the rules like a rule is just like a little piece of knowledge that says oh i have these two three four variables that are linked in this interesting way then i can say something about one or two of them given a couple of others right in addition to disentangling the elements of the representation which are like the variables in a rule based system you also need to disentangle the mechanisms that relate those variables to each other so like the rules so the rules are neatly separated like each rule is you know living on its own and when i change a rule because im learning it doesnt need to break other rules whereas current neural nets for example are very sensitive to whats called catastrophic forgetting where after ive learned some things and then i learn new things they can destroy the old things that i had learned right if the knowledge was better factorized and separated disentangled then you would avoid a lot of that now you cant do this in the sensory domain what do you mean by sensory domain like in pixel space but my idea is that when you project the data in the right semantic space it becomes possible to now represent this extra knowledge beyond the transformation from inputs to representations which is how representations act on each other and predict the future and so on in a way that can be neatly disentangled so now its the rules that are disentangled from each other and not just the variables that are disentangled from each other and you draw a distinction between semantic space and pixel like does there need to be an architectural difference well yeah so theres the sensory space like pixels which where everything is entangled the information like the variables are completely interdependent in very complicated ways and also computation like its not just the variables its also how they are related to each other is all intertwined but im hypothesizing that in the right high level representation space both the variables and how they relate to each other can be disentangled and that will provide a lot of generalization power generalization power yes distribution of the test set is assumed to be the same as the distribution of the training set right this is where current machine learning is too weak it doesnt tell us anything is not able to tell us anything about how our neural nets say are going to generalize to a new distribution and you know people may think well but theres nothing we can say if we dont know what the new distribution will be the truth is humans are able to generalize to new distributions yeah how are we able to do that yeah because there is something these new distributions even though they could look very different from the training distributions they have things in common so let me give you a concrete example you read a science fiction novel the science fiction novel maybe you know brings you in some other planet where things look very different on the surface but its still the same laws of physics and so you can read the book and you understand whats going on so the distribution is very different but because you can transport a lot of the knowledge you had from earth about the underlying cause and effect relationships and physical mechanisms and all that and maybe even social interactions you can now make sense of what is going on on this planet where like visually for example things are totally different taking that analogy further and distorting it lets enter a science fiction world of say space odyssey 2001 with hal or maybe which is probably one of my favorite ai movies me too and then theres another one that a lot of people love that may be a little bit outside of the ai community is ex machina i dont know if youve seen it yes yes by the way what are your views on that movie are you able to enjoy it are there things i like and things i hate so you could talk about that in the context of a question i want to ask which is theres quite a large community of people from different backgrounds often outside of ai who are concerned about existential threat of artificial intelligence youve seen this community develop over time youve seen you have a perspective so what do you think is the best way to talk about ai safety to think about it to have discourse about it within ai community and outside and grounded in the fact that ex machina is one of the main sources of information for the general public about ai so i think youre putting it right theres a big difference between the sort of discussion we ought to have within the ai community and the sort of discussion that really matter in the general public so i think the picture of terminator and ai loose and killing people and super intelligence thats going to destroy us whatever we try isnt really so useful for the public discussion because for the public discussion the things i believe really matter are the short term and medium term very likely negative impacts of ai on society whether its from security like you know big brother scenarios with face recognition or killer robots or the impact on the job market or concentration of power and discrimination all kinds of social issues which could actually some of them could really threaten democracy for example just to clarify when you said killer robots you mean autonomous weapon weapon systems yes i dont mean thats right so i think these short and medium term concerns should be important parts of the public debate now existential risk for me is a very unlikely consideration but still worth academic investigation in the same way that you could say should we study what could happen if meteorite you know came to earth and destroyed it so i think its very unlikely that this is going to happen in or happen in a reasonable future the sort of scenario of an ai getting loose goes against my understanding of at least current machine learning and current neural nets and so on its not plausible to me but of course i dont have a crystal ball and who knows what ai will be in 50 years from now so i think it is worth that scientists study those problems its just not a pressing question as far as im concerned so before i continue down that line i have a few questions there but what do you like and not like about ex machina as a movie because i actually watched it for the second time and enjoyed it i hated it the first time and i enjoyed it quite a bit more the second time when i sort of learned to accept certain pieces of it see it as a concept movie what was your experience what were your thoughts so the negative is the picture it paints of science is totally wrong science in general and ai in particular science is not happening in some hidden place by some you know really smart guy one person this is totally unrealistic this is not how it happens even a team of people in some isolated place will not make it science moves by small steps thanks to the collaboration and community of a large number of people interacting and all the scientists who are expert in their field kind of know what is going on even in the industrial labs its information flows and leaks and so on and the spirit of it is very different from the way science is painted in this movie yeah let me ask on that point its been the case to this point that kind of even if the research happens inside google or facebook inside companies it still kind of comes out ideas come out do you think that will always be the case with ai is it possible to bottle ideas to the point where theres a set of breakthroughs that go completely undiscovered by the general research community do you think thats even possible its possible but its unlikely its not how it is done now its not how i can foresee it in the foreseeable future but of course i dont have a crystal ball and science is a crystal ball and so who knows this is science fiction after all i think its ominous that the lights went off during that discussion so the problem again theres one thing is the movie and you could imagine all kinds of science fiction the problem for me maybe similar to the question about existential risk is that this kind of movie paints such a wrong picture of what is the actual science and how its going on that it can have unfortunate effects on peoples understanding of current science and so thats kind of sad theres an important principle in research which is diversity so in other words research is exploration research is exploration in the space of ideas and different people will focus on different directions and this is not just good its essential so im totally fine with people exploring directions that are contrary to mine or look orthogonal to mine i am more than fine i think its important i and my friends dont claim we have universal truth about what will especially about what will happen in the future now that being said we have our intuitions and then we act accordingly according to where we think we can be most useful and where society has the most to gain or to lose we should have those debates and not end up in a society where theres only one voice and one way of thinking and research money is spread out so disagreement is a sign of good research good science yes the idea of bias in the human sense of bias how do you think about instilling in machine learning something thats aligned with human values in terms of bias we intuitively as human beings have a concept of what bias means of what fundamental respect for other human beings means but how do we instill that into machine learning systems do you think so i think there are short term things that are already happening and then there are long term things that we need to do in the short term there are techniques that have been proposed and i think will continue to be improved and maybe alternatives will come up to take data sets in which we know there is bias we can measure it pretty much any data set where humans are being observed taking decisions will have some sort of bias discrimination against particular groups and so on and we can use machine learning techniques to try to build predictors classifiers that are going to be less biased we can do it for example using adversarial methods to make our systems less sensitive to these variables we should not be sensitive to so these are clear well defined ways of trying to address the problem maybe they have weaknesses and more research is needed and so on but i think in fact they are sufficiently mature that governments should start regulating companies where it matters say like insurance companies so that they use those techniques because those techniques will probably reduce the bias but at a cost for example maybe their predictions will be less accurate and so companies will not do it until you force them all right so this is short term long term im really interested in thinking how we can instill moral values into computers obviously this is not something well achieve in the next five or 10 years how can we you know theres already work in detecting emotions for example in images in sounds in texts and also studying how different agents interacting in different ways may correspond to patterns of say injustice which could trigger anger so these are things we can do in the medium term and eventually train computers to model for example how humans react emotionally i would say the simplest thing is unfair situations which trigger anger this is one of the most basic emotions that we share with other animals i think its quite feasible within the next few years that we can build systems that can detect these kinds of things to the extent unfortunately that they understand enough about the world around us which is a long time away but maybe we can initially do this in virtual environments so you can imagine a video game where agents interact in some ways and then some situations trigger an emotion i think we could train machines to detect those situations and predict that the particular emotion will likely be felt if a human was playing one of the characters you have shown excitement and done a lot of excellent work with unsupervised learning but theres been a lot of success on the supervised learning side yes yes and one of the things im really passionate about is how humans and robots work together and in the context of supervised learning that means the process of annotation do you think about the problem of annotation put in a more interesting way as humans teaching machines yes is there yes i think its an important subject reducing it to annotation may be useful for somebody building a system tomorrow but longer term the process of teaching i think is something that deserves a lot more attention from the machine learning community so there are people who have coined the term machine teaching so what are good strategies for teaching a learning agent and can we design and train a system that is going to be a good teacher so in my group we have a project called bbi or bbi game where there is a game or scenario where theres a learning agent and a teaching agent presumably the teaching agent would eventually be a human but were not there yet and the role of the teacher is to use its knowledge of the environment which it can acquire using whatever way brute force to help the learner learn as quickly as possible so the learner is going to try to learn by itself maybe using some exploration and whatever but the teacher can choose can have an influence on the interaction with the learner so as to guide the learner maybe teach it the things that the learner has most trouble with or just add the boundary between what it knows and doesnt know and so on so theres a tradition of these kind of ideas from other fields and like tutorial systems for example and ai and of course people in the humanities have been thinking about these questions but i think its time that machine learning people look at this because in the future well have more and more human machine interaction with the human in the loop and i think understanding how to make this work better all the problems around that are very interesting and not sufficiently addressed youve done a lot of work with language too what aspect of the traditionally formulated turing test a test of natural language understanding and generation in your eyes is the most difficult of conversation what in your eyes is the hardest part of conversation to solve for machines so i would say its everything having to do with the non linguistic knowledge which implicitly you need in order to make sense of sentences things like the winograd schema so these sentences that are semantically ambiguous in other words you need to understand enough about the world in order to really interpret properly those sentences i think these are interesting challenges for machine learning because they point in the direction of building systems that both understand how the world works and this causal relationships in the world and associate that knowledge with how to express it in language either for reading or writing you speak french yes its my mother tongue its one of the romance languages do you think passing the turing test and all the underlying challenges we just mentioned depend on language do you think it might be easier in french than it is in english or is independent of language i think its independent of language i would like to build systems that can use the same principles the same learning mechanisms to learn from human agents whatever their language well certainly us humans can talk more beautifully and smoothly in poetry some russian originally i know poetry in russian is maybe easier to convey complex ideas than it is in english but maybe im showing my bias and some people could say that about french but of course the goal ultimately is our human brain is able to utilize any kind of those languages to use them as tools to convey meaning yeah of course there are differences between languages and maybe some are slightly better at some things but in the grand scheme of things where were trying to understand how the brain works and language and so on i think these differences are minute so youve lived perhaps through an ai winter of sorts yes how did you stay warm and continue your research stay warm with friends with friends okay so its important to have friends and what have you learned from the experience listen to your inner voice dont you know be trying to just please the crowds and the fashion and if you have a strong intuition about something that is not contradicted by actual evidence go for it i mean it could be contradicted by people not your own instinct of based on everything youve learned of course you have to adapt your beliefs when your experiments contradict those beliefs but you have to stick to your beliefs otherwise its what allowed me to go through those years its what allowed me to persist in directions that you know took time whatever other people think took time to mature and bring fruits so history of ai is marked with these of course its marked with technical breakthroughs but its also marked with these seminal events that capture the imagination of the community most recent i would say alphago beating the world champion human go player was one of those moments what do you think the next such moment might be okay so first of all i think that these so called seminal events are overrated as i said science really moves by small steps now what happens is you make one more small step and its like the drop that you know that fills the bucket and then you have drastic consequences because now youre able to do something you were not able to do before or now say the cost of building some device or solving a problem becomes cheaper than what existed and you have a new market that opens up right so especially in the world of commerce and applications the impact of a small scientific progress could be huge but in the science itself i think its very very gradual and where are these steps being taken now so theres unsupervised learning so if i look at one trend that i like in my community so for example at milan my institute what are the two hardest topics gans and reinforcement learning even though in montreal in particular reinforcement learning was something pretty much absent just two or three years ago so theres really a big interest from students and theres a big interest from people like me so i would say this is something where were going to see more progress even though it hasnt yet provided much in terms of actual industrial fallout like even though theres alphago theres no like google is not making money on this right now but i think over the long term this is really really important for many reasons so in other words i would say reinforcement learning may be more generally agent learning because it doesnt have to be with rewards it could be in all kinds of ways that an agent is learning about its environment now reinforcement learning youre excited about do you think gans could provide something at the moment well gans or other generative models i believe will be crucial ingredients in building agents that can understand the world a lot of the successes in reinforcement learning in the past has been with policy gradient where you just learn a policy you dont actually learn a model of the world but there are lots of issues with that and we dont know how to do model based rl right now but i think this is where we have to go in order to build models that can generalize faster and better like to new distributions that capture to some extent at least the underlying causal mechanisms in the world last question what made you fall in love with artificial intelligence if you look back what was the first moment in your life when you were fascinated by either the human mind or the artificial mind you know when i was an adolescent i was reading a lot and then i started reading science fiction there you go thats it thats where i got hooked and then you know i had one of the first personal computers and i got hooked in programming and so it just you know start with fiction and then make it a reality thats right yoshua thank you so much for talking to me my pleasure', 'the following is a conversation with vladimir vapnik hes the co inventor of support vector machines support vector clustering vc theory and many foundational ideas in statistical learning he was born in the soviet union and worked at the institute of control sciences in moscow then in the united states he worked at att nec labs facebook research and now is a professor at columbia university his work has been cited over 170000 times he has some very interesting ideas about artificial intelligence and the nature of learning especially on the limits of our current approaches and the open problems in the field this conversation is part of mit course on artificial general intelligence and the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it please subscribe on youtube or rate it on itunes or your podcast provider of choice or simply connect with me on twitter or other social networks at lex friedman spelled f r i d and now heres my conversation with vladimir vapnik einstein famously said that god doesnt play dice yeah you have studied the world through the eyes of statistics so let me ask you in terms of the nature of reality fundamental nature of reality does god play dice we dont know some factors and because we dont know some factors which could be important it looks like god plays dice but we should describe it in philosophy they distinguish between two positions positions of instrumentalism where youre creating theory for prediction and position of realism where youre trying to understand what god did can you describe instrumentalism and realism a little bit for example if you have some mechanical laws what is that is it law which is true always and everywhere or it is law which allow you to predict position of moving element what you believe you believe that it is gods law that god created the world which obey to this physical law or it is just law for predictions and which one is instrumentalism for predictions if you believe that this is law of god and its always true everywhere that means that youre realist so youre trying to really understand gods thought so the way you see the world is as an instrumentalist you know im working for some models model of machine learning so in this model we can see setting and we try to solve resolve the setting to solve the problem and you can do in two different way from the point of view of instrumentalist and thats what everybody does now because they say that goal of machine learning is to find the rule for classification that is true but it is instrument for prediction but i can say the goal of machine learning is to learn about conditional probability so how god played use and if he play what is probability for one what is probability for another given situation but for prediction i dont need this i need the rule but for understanding i need conditional probability so let me just step back a little bit first to talk about you mentioned which i read last night the parts of the 1960 paper by eugene wigner unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics and natural sciences such a beautiful paper by the way made me feel to be honest to confess my own work in the past few years on deep learning heavily applied made me feel that i was missing out on some of the beauty of nature in the way that math can uncover so let me just step away from the poetry of that for a second how do you see the role of math in your life is it a tool is it poetry where does it sit and does math for you have limits of what it can describe some people say that math is language which use god use god so i believe that speak to god or use god or use god use god yeah so i believe that this article about effectiveness unreasonable effectiveness of math is that if youre looking at mathematical structures they know something about reality and the most scientists from natural science theyre looking on equation and trying to understand reality so the same in machine learning if you try very carefully look on all equations which define conditional probability you can understand something about reality more than from your fantasy so math can reveal the simple underlying principles of reality perhaps you know what means simple it is very hard to discover them but then when you discover them and look at them you see how beautiful they are and it is surprising why people did not see that before youre looking on equation and derive it from equations for example i talked yesterday about least square method and people had a lot of fantasy how to improve least square method but if youre going step by step by solving some equations you suddenly will get some term which after thinking you understand that it describes position of observation point in least square method we throw out a lot of information we dont look in composition of point of observations were looking only on residuals but when you understood that thats very simple idea but its not too simple to understand and you can derive this just from equations so some simple algebra a few steps will take you to something surprising that when you think about you understand and that is proof that human intuition is not too rich and very primitive and it does not see very simple situations so let me take a step back in general yes but what about human as opposed to intuition ingenuity moments of brilliance do you have to be so hard on human intuition are there moments of brilliance in human intuition they can leap ahead of math and then the math will catch up i dont think so i think that the best human intuition it is putting in axioms and then it is technical see where the axioms take you but if they correctly take axioms but it axiom polished during generations of scientists and this is integral wisdom that is beautifully put but if you maybe look at when you think of einstein and special relativity what is the role of imagination coming first there in the moment of discovery of an idea so there is obviously a mix of math and out of the box imagination there that i dont know whatever i did i exclude any imagination because whatever i saw in machine learning that comes from imagination like features like deep learning they are not relevant to the problem when you are looking very carefully from mathematical equations you are deriving very simple theory which goes far beyond theoretically than whatever people can imagine because it is not good fantasy it is just interpretation it is just fantasy but it is not what you need you dont need any imagination to derive the main principle of machine learning when you think about learning and intelligence maybe thinking about the human brain and trying to describe mathematically the process of learning that is something like what happens in the human brain do you think we have the tools currently do you think we will ever have the tools to try to describe that process of learning it is not description what is going on it is interpretation it is your interpretation your vision can be wrong you know one guy invented microscope levenhuk for the first time only he got this instrument and he kept secret about microscope but he wrote a report in london academy of science in his report when he was looking at the blood he looked everywhere on the water on the blood on the sperm but he described blood like fight between queen and king so he saw blood cells red cells and he imagined that it is army fighting each other and it was his interpretation of situation and he sent this report in academy of science they very carefully looked because they believed that he is right he saw something yes but he gave wrong interpretation and i believe the same can happen with brain with brain yeah the most important part you know i believe in human language in some proverbs there is so much wisdom for example people say that it is better than thousand days of diligent studies one day with great teacher but if i will ask you what teacher does nobody knows and that is intelligence but we know from history and now from math and machine learning that teacher can do a lot so what from a mathematical point of view is the great teacher i dont know thats an open question no but we can say what teacher can do he can introduce some invariants some predicate for creating invariants how he doing it i dont know because teacher knows reality and can describe from this reality a predicate invariants but he knows that when youre using invariant you can decrease number of observations hundred times so but maybe try to pull that apart a little bit i think you mentioned like a piano teacher saying to the student play like a butterfly yeah i play piano i play guitar for a long time yeah maybe its romantic poetic but it feels like theres a lot of truth in that statement like there is a lot of instruction in that statement and so can you pull that apart what is that the language itself may not contain this information it is not blah blah blah it is not blah blah blah it affects you its what it affects you it affects your playing yes it does but its not the laying it feels like what is the information being exchanged there what is the nature of information what is the representation of that information i believe that it is sort of predicate but i dont know that is exactly what intelligence and machine learning should be yes because the rest is just mathematical technique i think that what was discovered recently is that there is two mechanism of learning one called strong convergence mechanism and weak convergence mechanism before people use only one convergence in weak convergence mechanism you can use predicate thats what play like butterfly and it will immediately affect your playing you know there is english proverb great if it looks like a duck swims like a duck and quack like a duck then it is probably duck yes but this is exact about predicate looks like a duck what it means you saw many ducks that youre training data so you have description of how looks integral looks ducks yeah the visual characteristics of a duck yeah but you want and you have model for recognition so you would like so that theoretical description from model coincide with empirical description which you saw on territory so about looks like a duck it is general but what about swims like a duck you should know that duck swims you can say it play chess like a duck okay duck doesnt play chess and it is completely legal predicate but it is useless so half teacher can recognize not useless predicate so up to now we dont use this predicate in existing machine learning so why we need zillions of data but in this english proverb they use only three predicate looks like a duck swims like a duck and quack like a duck so you cant deny the fact that swims like a duck and quacks like a duck has humor in it has ambiguity lets talk about swim like a duck it doesnt say jump like a duck why because its not relevant but that means that you know ducks you know different birds you know animals and you derive from this that it is relevant to say swim like a duck so underneath in order for us to understand swims like a duck it feels like we need to know millions of other little pieces of information which we pick up along the way you dont think so there doesnt need to be this knowledge base in those statements carries some rich information that helps us understand the essence of duck yeah how far are we from integrating predicates you know that when you consider complete theory of machine learning so what it does you have a lot of functions and then youre talking it looks like a duck you see your training data from training data you recognize like expected duck should look then you remove all functions which does not look like you think it should look from training data so you decrease amount of function from which you pick up one then you give a second predicate and again decrease the set of function and after that you pick up the best function you can find it is standard machine learning so why you need not too many examples because your predicates arent very good that means that predicates are very good because every predicate is invented to decrease admissible set of function so you talk about admissible set of functions and you talk about good functions so what makes a good function so admissible set of function is set of function which has small capacity or small diversity small vc dimension example which contain good function inside so by the way for people who dont know vc youre the v in the vc so how would you describe to lay person what vc theory is how would you describe vc so when you have a machine so machine capable to pick up one function from the admissible set of function but set of admissible function can be big so it contain all continuous functions and its useless you dont have so many examples to pick up function but it can be small small we call it capacity but maybe better called diversity so not very different function in the set its infinite set of function but not very diverse so it is small vc dimension when vc dimension is small you need small amount of training data so the goal is to create admissible set of functions which is have small vc dimension and contain good function then you will be able to pick up the function using small amount of observations so that is the task of learning yeah is creating a set of admissible functions that has a small vc dimension and then youve figure out a clever way of picking up no that is goal of learning which i formulated yesterday statistical learning theory does not involve in creating admissible set of function in classical learning theory everywhere 100 in textbook the set of function admissible set of function is given but this is science about nothing because the most difficult problem to create admissible set of functions given say a lot of functions continuum set of function create admissible set of functions that means that it has finite vc dimension small vc dimension and contain good function so this was out of consideration so whats the process of doing that i mean its fascinating what is the process of creating this admissible set of functions that is invariant thats invariant yeah youre looking of properties of training data and properties means that you have some function and you just count what is value average value of function on training data you have model and what is expectation of this function on the model and they should coincide so the problem is about how to pick up functions it can be any function in fact it is true for all functions but because when were talking say duck does not jumping so you dont ask question jump like a duck because it is trivial it does not jumping and doesnt help you to recognize jump but you know something which question to ask and youre asking it seems like a duck but looks like a duck at this general situation looks like say guy who have this illness this disease it is legal so there is a general type of predicate looks like and special type of predicate which related to this specific problem and that is intelligence part of all this business and that where teacher is involved incorporating the specialized predicates what do you think about deep learning as neural networks these arbitrary architectures as helping accomplish some of the tasks youre thinking about their effectiveness or lack thereof what are the weaknesses and what are the possible strengths you know i think that this is fantasy everything which like deep learning like features let me give you this example one of the greatest books is churchill book about history of second world war and he started this book describing that in old time when war is over so the great kings they gathered together almost all of them were relatives and they discussed what should be done how to create peace and they came to agreement and when happened first world war the general public came in power and they were so greedy that robbed germany and it was clear for everybody that it is not peace that peace will last only 20 years because they were not professionals and the same i see in machine learning there are mathematicians who are looking for the problem from a very deep point of view mathematical point of view and there are computer scientists who mostly does not know mathematics they just have interpretation of that and they invented a lot of blah blah blah interpretations like deep learning why you need deep learning mathematic does not know deep learning mathematic does not know neurons it is just function if you like to say piecewise linear function say that and do in class of piecewise linear function but they invent something and then they try to prove advantage of that through interpretations which mostly wrong and when its not enough they appeal to brain which they know nothing about that nobody knows whats going on in the brain so i think that more reliable work on math this is a mathematical problem do your best to solve this problem try to understand that there is not only one way of convergence which is strong way of convergence there is a weak way of convergence which requires predicate and if you will go through all this stuff you will see that you dont need deep learning even more i would say one of the theory which called represented theory it says that optimal solution of mathematical problem which is described learning is on shadow network not on deep learning and a shallow network yeah the ultimate problem is there absolutely in the end what youre saying is exactly right the question is you have no value for throwing something on the table playing with it not math its like a neural network where you said throwing something in the bucket or the biological example and looking at kings and queens or the cells or the microscope you dont see value in imagining the cells or kings and queens and using that as inspiration and imagination for where the math will eventually lead you you think that interpretation basically deceives you in a way thats not productive i think that if youre trying to analyze this business of learning and especially discussion about deep learning it is discussion about interpretation not about things about what you can say about things thats right but arent you surprised by the beauty of it so not mathematical beauty but the fact that it works at all or are you criticizing that very beauty our human desire to interpret to find our silly interpretations in these constructs let me ask you this are you surprised and does it inspire you how do you feel about the success of a system like alphago at beating the game of go using neural networks to estimate the quality of a board and the quality of the position that is your interpretation quality of the board yeah yes yeah so its not our interpretation the fact is a neural network system it doesnt matter a learning system that we dont i think mathematically understand that well beats the best human player does something that was thought impossible that means that its not a very difficult problem so you empirically weve empirically have discovered that this is not a very difficult problem yeah its true so maybe cant argue so even more i would say that if they use deep learning it is not the most effective way of learning theory and usually when people use deep learning theyre using zillions of training data yeah but you dont need this so i describe challenge can we do some problems which do well deep learning method this deep net using hundred times less training data even more some problems deep learning cannot solve because its not necessary they create admissible set of function to create deep architecture means to create admissible set of functions you cannot say that youre creating good admissible set of functions you just its your fantasy it does not come from us but it is possible to create admissible set of functions because you have your training data that actually for mathematicians when you consider a variant you need to use law of large numbers when youre making training in existing algorithm you need uniform law of large numbers which is much more difficult it requires vc dimension and all this stuff but nevertheless if you use both weak and strong way of convergence you can decrease a lot of training data you could do the three the swims like a duck and quacks like a duck so lets step back and think about human intelligence in general clearly that has evolved in a non mathematical way it wasnt as far as we know god or whoever didnt come up with a model and place in our brain of admissible functions it kind of evolved i dont know maybe you have a view on this so alan turing in the 50s in his paper asked and rejected the question can machines think its not a very useful question but can you briefly entertain this useful useless question can machines think so talk about intelligence and your view of it i dont know that i know that turing described imitation if computer can imitate human being lets call it intelligent and he understands that it is not thinking computer he completely understands what hes doing but he set up problem of imitation so now we understand that the problem is not in imitation im not sure that intelligence is just inside of us it may be also outside of us i have several observations so when i prove some theorem its very difficult theorem in couple of years in several places people prove the same theorem say sawyer lemma after us was done then another guys proved the same theorem in the history of science its happened all the time for example geometry its happened simultaneously first it did lobachevsky and then gauss and boyai and another guys and its approximately in 10 times period 10 years period of time and i saw a lot of examples like that and many mathematicians think that when they develop something they develop something in general which affect everybody so maybe our model that intelligence is only inside of us is incorrect its our interpretation it might be there exists some connection with world intelligence i dont know youre almost like plugging in into yeah exactly and contributing to this into a big network into a big maybe in your own network on the flip side of that maybe you can comment on big o complexity and how you see classifying algorithms by worst case running time in relation to their input so that way of thinking about functions do you think p equals np do you think thats an interesting question yeah it is an interesting question but let me talk about complexity in about worst case scenario there is a mathematical setting when i came to united states in 1990 people did not know they did not know statistical learning theory so in russia it was published to monographs our monographs but in america they didnt know then they learned and somebody told me that it is worst case theory and they will create real case theory but till now it did not because it is mathematical too you can do only what you can do using mathematics and which has a clear understanding and clear description and for this reason we introduce complexity and we need this because using actually it is diversity i like this one more you see the mention you can prove some theorems but we also create theory for case when you know probability measure and that is the best case which can happen it is entropy theory so from mathematical point of view you know the best possible case and the worst possible case you can derive different model in medium but its not so interesting you think the edges are interesting the edges are interesting because it is not so easy to get good bound exact bound its not many cases where you have the bound is not exact but interesting principles which discover the mass do you think its interesting because its challenging and reveals interesting principles that allow you to get those bounds or do you think its interesting because its actually very useful for understanding the essence of a function of an algorithm so its like me judging your life as a human being by the worst thing you did and the best thing you did versus all the stuff in the middle it seems not productive i dont think so because you cannot describe situation in the middle so it will be not general so you can describe edges cases and it is clear it has some model but you cannot describe model for every new case so you will be never accurate when youre using model but from a statistical point of view the way youve studied functions and the nature of learning in the world dont you think that the real world has a very long tail that the edge cases are very far away from the mean the stuff in the middle or no i dont know that i think that from my point of view if you will use formal statistic you need uniform law of large numbers if you will use this invariance business you will need just law of large numbers and theres this huge difference between uniform law of large numbers and large numbers is it useful to describe that a little more or should we just take it to for example when im talking about duck i give three predicates and that was enough but if you will try to do formal distinguish you will need a lot of observations so that means that information about looks like a duck contain a lot of bit of information formal bits of information so we dont know that how much bit of information contain things from artificial and from intelligence and that is the subject of analysis till now all business i dont like how people consider artificial intelligence they consider us some codes which imitate activity of human being it is not science it is applications you would like to imitate go ahead it is very useful and a good problem but you need to learn something more how people try to do how people can to develop say predicates seems like a duck or play like butterfly or something like that not the teacher says you how it came in his mind how he choose this image so that process that is problem of intelligence that is the problem of intelligence and you see that connected to the problem of learning absolutely because you immediately give this predicate like specific predicate seems like a duck or quack like a duck it was chosen somehow so what is the line of work would you say if you were to formulate as a set of open problems that will take us there to play like a butterfly well get a system to be able to lets separate two stories one mathematical story that if you have predicate you can do something and another story how to get predicate it is intelligence problem and people even did not start to understand intelligence because to understand intelligence first of all try to understand what do teachers how teacher teach why one teacher better than another one yeah and so you think we really even havent started on the journey of generating the predicates no we dont understand we even dont understand that this problem exists because did you hear you do no i just know name i want to understand why one teacher better than another and how affect teacher student it is not because he repeating the problem which is in textbook he makes some remarks he makes some philosophy of reasoning yeah thats a beautiful so it is a formulation of a question that is the open problem why is one teacher better than another right what he does better yeah what what why in at every level how do they get better what does it mean to be better the whole yeah yeah from whatever model i have one teacher can give a very good predicate one teacher can say swims like a dog and another can say jump like a dog and jump like a dog carries zero information so what is the most exciting problem in statistical learning youve ever worked on or are working on now i just finished this invariant story and im happy that i believe that it is ultimate learning story at least i can show that there are no another mechanism only two mechanisms but they separate statistical part from intelligent part and i know nothing about intelligent part and if you will know this intelligent part so it will help us a lot in teaching in learning in learning yeah you will know it when we see it so for example in my talk the last slide was a challenge so you have say nist digit recognition problem and deep learning claims that they did it very well say 995 of correct answers but they use 60000 observations can you do the same using hundred times less but incorporating invariants what it means you know digit one two three but looking on that explain to me which invariant i should keep to use hundred examples or say hundred times less examples to do the same job yeah that last slide unfortunately your talk ended quickly but that last slide was a powerful open challenge and a formulation of the essence here what is the exact problem of intelligence because everybody when machine learning started and it was developed by mathematicians they immediately recognized that we use much more training data than humans needed but now again we came to the same story have to decrease that is the problem of learning it is not like in deep learning they use zillions of training data because maybe zillions are not enough if you have a good invariants maybe you will never collect some number of observations but now it is a question to intelligence how to do that because statistical part is ready as soon as you supply us with predicate we can do good job with small amount of observations and the very first challenge is well known digit recognition and you know digits and please tell me invariants i think about that i can say for digit three i would introduce concept of horizontal symmetry so the digit three has horizontal symmetry say more than say digit two or something like that but as soon as i get the idea of horizontal symmetry i can mathematically invent a lot of measure of horizontal symmetry or then vertical symmetry or diagonal symmetry whatever if i have idea of symmetry but what else i think on digit i see that it is meta predicate which is not shape it is something like symmetry like how dark is whole picture something like that which can self rise a predicate you think such a predicate could rise out of something that is not general meaning it feels like for me to be able to understand the difference between two and three i would need to have had a childhood of 10 to 15 years playing with kids going to school being yelled by parents all of that walking jumping looking at ducks and then i would be able to generate the right predicate for telling the difference between two and a three or do you think theres a more efficient way i dont know i know for sure that you must know something more than digits yes and thats a powerful statement yeah but maybe there are several languages of description these elements of digits so im talking about symmetry about some properties of geometry im talking about something abstract i dont know that but this is a problem of intelligence so in one of our articles it is trivial to show that every example can carry not more than one bit of information in real because when you show example and you say this is one you can remove say a function which does not tell you one say is the best strategy if you can do it perfectly its remove half of the functions but when you use one predicate which looks like a duck you can remove much more functions than half and that means that it contains a lot of bit of information from formal point of view but when you have a general picture of what you want to recognize and general picture of the world can you invent this predicate and that predicate carries a lot of information beautifully put maybe just me but in all the math you show in your work which is some of the most profound mathematical work in the field of learning ai and just math in general i hear a lot of poetry and philosophy you really kind of talk about philosophy of science theres a poetry and music to a lot of the work youre doing and the way youre thinking about it so do you where does that come from do you escape to poetry do you escape to music or not i think that there exists ground truth there exists ground truth yeah and that can be seen everywhere the smart guy philosopher sometimes im surprised how they deep see sometimes i see that some of them are completely out of subject but the ground truth i see in music music is the ground truth yeah and in poetry many poets they believe they take dictation so what piece of music as a piece of empirical evidence gave you a sense that they are touching something in the ground truth it is structure the structure of the math of music yeah because when youre listening to bach you see the structure very clear very classic very simple and the same in math when you have axioms in geometry you have the same feeling and in poetry sometimes you see the same and if you look back at your childhood you grew up in russia you maybe were born as a researcher in russia youve developed as a researcher in russia youve came to united states and a few places if you look back what was some of your happiest moments as a researcher some of the most profound moments not in terms of their impact on society but in terms of their impact on how damn good you feel that day and you remember that moment you know every time when you found something it is great in the life every simple things but my general feeling is that most of my time was wrong you should go again and again and again and try to be honest in front of yourself not to make interpretation but try to understand that its related to ground truth it is not my blah blah blah interpretation and something like that but youre allowed to get excited at the possibility of discovery oh yeah you have to double check it no but how its related to another ground truth is it just temporary or it is for forever you know you always have a feeling when you found something how big is that so 20 years ago when we discovered statistical learning theory nobody believed except for one guy dudley from mit and then in 20 years it became fashion and the same with support vector machines that is kernel machines so with support vector machines and learning theory when you were working on it you had a sense you had a sense of the profundity of it how this seems to be right this seems to be powerful right absolutely immediately i recognized that it will last forever and now when i found this invariant story i have a feeling that it is complete learning because i have proof that there are no different mechanisms you can have some cosmetic improvement you can do but in terms of invariants you need both invariants and statistical learning and they should work together but also im happy that we can formulate what is intelligence from that and to separate from technical part and that is completely different absolutely well vladimir thank you so much for talking today thank you its an

friedman spelled f r i d and now heres my conversation with guido van rossum you were born in the netherlands in 1956 your parents and the world around you was deeply deeply impacted by world war two as was my family from the soviet union so with that context what is your view of human nature are some humans inherently good and some inherently evil or do we all have both good and evil within us guido van rossum ouch i did not expect such a deep one i i guess we all have good and evil potential in us and a lot of it depends on circumstances and context peter bell out of that world at least on the soviet union side in europe sort of out of suffering out of challenge out of that kind of set of traumatic events often emerges beautiful art music literature in an interview i read or heard you said you enjoyed dutch literature when you were a child can you tell me about the books that had an influence on you in your childhood guido van rossum well with as a teenager my favorite writer was my favorite dutch author was a guy named willem frederik hermans whos writing certainly his early novels were all about sort of ambiguous things that happened during world war two i think he was a young adult during that time and he wrote about it a lot and very interesting very good books i thought i think peter bell in a nonfiction way guido van rossum no it was all fiction but it was very much set in the ambiguous world of resistance against the germans where often you couldnt tell whether someone was truly in the resistance or really a spy for the germans and some of the characters in his novels sort of crossed that line and you never really find out what exactly happened peter bell and in his novels theres always a good guy and a bad guy the nature of good and evil is it clear theres a hero guido van rossum no his heroes are often more his main characters are often anti heroes and so theyre not very heroic theyre often they fail at some level to accomplish their lofty goals peter bell and looking at the trajectory through the rest of your life has literature dutch or english or translation had an impact outside the technical world that you existed in guido van rossum i still read novels i dont think that it impacts me that much directly peter bell it doesnt impact your work guido van rossum its a separate world my work is highly technical and sort of the world of art and literature doesnt really directly have any bearing on it peter bell you dont think theres a creative element to the design you know some would say design of a language is art guido van rossum im not disagreeing with that im just saying that sort of i dont feel direct influences from more traditional art on my own creativity peter bell right of course you dont feel doesnt mean its not somehow deeply there in your subconscious guido van rossum who knows peter bell who knows so lets go back to your early teens your hobbies were building electronic circuits building mechanical models what if you can just put yourself back in the mind of that young guido 12 13 14 was that grounded in a desire to create a system so to create something or was it more just tinkering just the joy of puzzle solving guido van rossum i think it was more the latter actually i maybe towards the end of my high school period i felt confident enough that that i designed my own circuits that were sort of interesting somewhat but a lot of that time i literally just took a model kit and follow the instructions putting the things together i mean i think the first few years that i built electronics kits i really did not have enough understanding of sort of electronics to really understand what i was doing i mean i could debug it and i could sort of follow the instructions very carefully which has always stayed with me but i had a very naive model of like how do i build a circuit of like how a transistor works and i dont think that in those days i had any understanding of coils and capacitors which actually sort of was a major problem when i started to build more complex digital circuits because i was unaware of the sort of the analog part of the – how they actually work and i would have things that – the schematic looked – everything looked fine and it didnt work and what i didnt realize was that there was some megahertz level oscillation that was throwing the circuit off because i had a sort of – two wires were too close or the switches were kind of poorly built but through that time i think its really interesting and instructive to think about because echoes of it are in this time now so in the 1970s the personal computer was being born so did you sense in tinkering with these circuits did you sense the encroaching revolution in personal computing so if at that point we would sit you down and ask you to predict the 80s and the 90s do you think you would be able to do so successfully to unroll the process thats happening no i had no clue i remember i think in the summer after my senior year – or maybe it was the summer after my junior year – well at some point i think when i was 18 i went on a trip to the math olympiad in eastern europe and there was like – i was part of the dutch team and there were other nerdy kids that sort of had different experiences and one of them told me about this amazing thing called a computer and i had never heard that word my own explorations in electronics were sort of about very simple digital circuits and i had sort of – i had the idea that i somewhat understood how a digital calculator worked and so there is maybe some echoes of computers there but i never made that connection i didnt know that when my parents were paying for magazine subscriptions using punched cards that there was something called a computer that was involved that read those cards and transferred the money between accounts i was also not really interested in those things it was only when i went to university to study math that i found out that they had a computer and students were allowed to use it and there were some – youre supposed to talk to that computer by programming it what did that feel like finding – yeah that was the only thing you could do with it the computer wasnt really connected to the real world the only thing you could do was sort of – you typed your program on a bunch of punched cards you gave the punched cards to the operator and an hour later the operator gave you back your printout and so all you could do was write a program that did something very abstract and i dont even remember what my first forays into programming were but they were sort of doing simple math exercises and just to learn how a programming language worked did you sense okay first year of college you see this computer youre able to have a program and it generates some output did you start seeing the possibility of this or was it a continuation of the tinkering with circuits did you start to imagine that one the personal computer but did you see it as something that is a tool like a word processing tool maybe for gaming or something or did you start to imagine that it could be going to the world of robotics like the frankenstein picture that you could create an artificial being theres like another entity in front of you you did not see the computer i dont think i really saw it that way i was really more interested in the tinkering its maybe not a sort of a complete coincidence that i ended up sort of creating a programming language which is a tool for other programmers ive always been very focused on the sort of activity of programming itself and not so much what happens with the program you write right i do remember and i dont remember maybe in my second or third year probably my second actually someone pointed out to me that there was this thing called conways game of life youre probably familiar with it i think – in the 70s i think is when they came up with it so there was a scientific american column by someone who did a monthly column about mathematical diversions im also blanking out on the guys name it was very famous at the time and i think up to the 90s or so and one of his columns was about conways game of life and he had some illustrations and he wrote down all the rules and sort of there was the suggestion that this was philosophically interesting that that was why conway had called it that and all i had was like the two pages photocopy of that article i dont even remember where i got it but it spoke to me and i remember implementing a version of that game for the batch computer we were using where i had a whole pascal program that sort of read an initial situation from input and read some numbers that said do so many generations and print every so many generations and then out would come pages and pages of sort of things i remember much later ive done a similar thing using python but that original version i wrote at the time i found interesting because i combined it with some trick i had learned during my electronics hobbyist times i essentially first on paper i designed a simple circuit built out of logic gates that took nine bits of input which is sort of the cell and its neighbors and produced a new value for that cell and its like a combination of a half adder and some other clipping its actually a full adder and so i had worked that out and then i translated that into a series of boolean operations on pascal integers where you could use the integers as bitwise values and so i could basically generate 60 bits of a generation in like eight instructions or so nice so i was proud of that its funny that you mentioned so for people who dont know conways game of life its a cellular automata where theres single compute units that kind of look at their neighbors and figure out what they look like in the next generation based on the state of their neighbors and this is deeply distributed system in concept at least and then theres simple rules that all of them follow and somehow out of this simple rule when you step back and look at what occurs its beautiful theres an emergent complexity even though the underlying rules are simple theres an emergent complexity now the funny thing is youve implemented this and the thing youre commenting on is youre proud of a hack you did to make it run efficiently when youre not commenting on its a beautiful implementation youre not commenting on the fact that theres an emergent complexity that youve coded a simple program and when you step back and you print out the following generation after generation thats stuff that you may have not predicted would happen is happening and is that magic i mean thats the magic that all of us feel when we program when you create a program and then you run it and whether its hello world or it shows something on screen if theres a graphical component are you seeing the magic in the mechanism of creating that i think i went back and forth as a student we had an incredibly small budget of computer time that we could use it was actually measured i once got in trouble with one of my professors because i had overspent the departments budget its a different story i actually wanted the efficient implementation because i also wanted to explore what would happen with a larger number of generations and a larger size of the board once the implementation was flawless i would feed it different patterns and then i think maybe there was a follow up article where there were patterns that were like gliders patterns that repeated themselves after a number of generations but translated one or two positions to the right or up or something like that i remember things like glider guns well you can google conways game of life people still go aww and ooh over it for a reason because its not really well understood why i mean this is what stephen wolfram is obsessed about we dont have the mathematical tools to describe the kind of complexity that emerges in these kinds of systems the only way you can do is to run it im not convinced that its sort of a problem that lends itself to classic mathematical analysis one theory of how you create an artificial intelligence or artificial being is you kind of have to same with the game of life you kind of have to create a universe and let it run that creating it from scratch in a design way coding up a python program that creates a fully intelligent system may be quite challenging you might need to create a universe just like the game of life you might have to experiment with a lot of different universes before there is a set of rules that doesnt essentially always just end up repeating itself in a trivial way yeah and stephen wolfram works with these simple rules says that its kind of surprising how quickly you find rules that create interesting things you shouldnt be able to but somehow you do and so maybe our universe is laden with rules that will create interesting things that might not look like humans but emergent phenomena thats interesting may not be as difficult to create as we think sure but let me sort of ask at that time some of the world at least in popular press was kind of captivated perhaps at least in america by the idea of artificial intelligence that these computers would be able to think pretty soon and did that touch you at all in science fiction or in reality in any way i didnt really start reading science fiction until much much later i think as a teenager i read maybe one bundle of science fiction stories was it in the background somewhere like in your thoughts that sort of the using computers to build something intelligent always felt to me because and how did you try to design it into the language there are different tasks and as a programmer its useful to have different tools available that sort of are suitable for different tasks so i still write c code i still write shell code but i write most of my things in python why do i still use those other languages because sometimes the task just demands it and well i would say most of the time the task actually demands a certain language because the task is not write a program that solves problem x from scratch but its more like fix a bug in existing program x or add a small feature to an existing large program but even if youre not constrained in your choice of language by context like that there is still the fact that if you write it in a certain language then you have this balance between how long does it take you to write the code and how long does the code run and when youre in the phase of exploring solutions you often spend much more time writing the code than running it because every time youve run it you see that the output is not quite what you wanted and you spend some more time coding and a language like python just makes that iteration much faster because there are fewer details that you have to get right before your program compiles and runs there are libraries that do all sorts of stuff for you so you can sort of very quickly take a bunch of existing components put them together and get your prototype application running just like when i was building electronics i was using a breadboard most of the time so i had this sprawl out circuit that if you shook it it would stop working because it was not put together very well but it functioned and all i wanted was to see that it worked and then move on to the next schematic or design or add something to it once youve sort of figured out oh this is the perfect design for my radio or light sensor or whatever then you can say okay how do we design a pcb for this how do we solder the components in a small space how do we make it so that it is robust against say voltage fluctuations or mechanical disruption i know nothing about that when it comes to designing electronics but i know a lot about that when it comes to writing code so the initial steps are efficient fast and theres not much stuff that gets in the way but youre kind of describing like darwin described the evolution of species right youre observing of what is true about python now if you take a step back if the act of creating languages is art and you had three months to do it initial steps so you just specified a bunch of goals sort of things that you observe about python perhaps you had those goals but how do you create the rules the syntactic structure the features that result in those so i have in the beginning and i have follow up questions about through the evolution of python too but in the very beginning when you were sitting there creating the lexical analyzer or whatever python was still a big part of it because i sort of i said to myself i dont want to have to design everything from scratch im going to borrow features from other languages that i like oh interesting so you basically exactly you first observe what you like yeah and so thats why if youre 17 years old and you want to sort of create a programming language youre not going to be very successful at it because you have no experience with other languages whereas i was in my lets say mid 30s i had written parsers before so i had worked on the implementation of abc i had spent years debating the design of abc with its authors with its designers i had nothing to do with the design it was designed fully as it ended up being implemented when i joined the team but so you borrow ideas and concepts and very concrete sort of local rules from different languages like the indentation and certain other syntactic features from abc but i chose to borrow string literals and how numbers work from c and various other things so in then if you take that further so yet youve had this funny sounding but i think surprisingly accurate and at least practical title of benevolent dictator for life for quite you know for the last three decades or whatever or no not the actual title but functionally speaking so you had to make decisions design decisions can you maybe lets take python 2 so releasing python 3 as an example its not backward compatible to python 2 in ways that a lot of people know so what was that deliberation discussion decision like yeah what was the psychology of that experience do you regret any aspects of how that experience undergone that well yeah so it was a group process really at that point even though i was bdfl in name and certainly everybody sort of respected my position as the creator and the current sort of owner of the language design i was looking at everyone else for feedback sort of python 30 in some sense was sparked by other people in the community pointing out oh well there are a few issues that sort of bite users over and over can we do something about that and for python 3 we took a number of those python words as they were called at the time and we said can we try to sort of make small changes to the language that address those words and we had sort of in the past we had always taken backwards compatibility very seriously and so many python words in earlier versions had already been resolved because they could be resolved while maintaining backwards compatibility or sort of using a very gradual path of evolution of the language in a certain area and so we were stuck with a number of words that were widely recognized as problems not like roadblocks but nevertheless sort of things that some people trip over and you know that thats always the same thing that people trip over when they trip and we could not think of a backwards compatible way of resolving those issues but its still an option to not resolve the issues right and so yes for a long time we had sort of resigned ourselves to well okay the language is not going to be perfect in this way and that way and that way and we sort of certain of these i mean there are still plenty of things where you can say well that particular detail is better in java or in r or in visual basic or whatever and were okay with that because well we cant easily change it its not too bad we can do a little bit with user education or we can have a static analyzer or warnings in the parse or something but there were things where we thought well these are really problems that are not going away they are getting worse in the future we should do something about that but ultimately there is a decision to be made right so was that the toughest decision in the history of python you had to make as the benevolent dictator for life or if not what are there maybe even on the smaller scale what was the decision where you were really torn up about well the toughest decision was probably to resign all right lets go there hold on a second then let me just because in the interest of time too because i have a few cool questions for you and lets touch a really important one because it was quite dramatic and beautiful in certain kinds of ways in july this year three months ago you wrote now that pep 572 is done i dont ever want to have to fight so hard for a pep and find that so many people despise my decisions i would like to remove myself entirely from the decision process ill still be there for a while as an ordinary core developer and ill still be available to mentor people possibly more available but im basically giving myself a permanent vacation from being bdfl benevolent dictator for life and you all will be on your own first of all its almost shakespearean im not going to appoint a successor so what are you all going to do create a democracy anarchy a dictatorship a federation so that was a very dramatic and beautiful set of statements its almost its open ended nature called the community to create a future for python its just kind of a beautiful aspect to it so what and dramatic you know what was making that decision like what was on your heart on your mind stepping back now a few months later im glad you liked the writing because it was actually written pretty quickly it was literally something like after months and months of going around in circles i had finally approved pep572 which i had a big hand in its design although i didnt initiate it originally i sort of gave it a bunch of nudges in a direction that would be better for the language so sorry just to ask is async io thats the one or no pep572 was actually a small feature which is assignment expressions that had been there was just a lot of debate where a lot of people claimed that they knew what was pythonic and what was not pythonic and they knew that this was going to destroy the language this was like a violation of pythons most fundamental design philosophy and i thought that was all bullshit because i was in favor of it and i would think i know something about pythons design philosophy so i was really tired and also stressed of that thing and literally after sort of announcing i was going to accept it a certain wednesday evening i had finally sent the email its accepted i can just go implement it so i went to bed feeling really relieved thats behind me and i wake up thursday morning 7 am and i think well that was the last one thats going to be such a terrible debate and thats the last time that i let myself be so stressed out about a pep decision i should just resign ive been sort of thinking about retirement for half a decade ive been joking and sort of mentioning retirement sort of telling the community at some point in the future im going to retire dont take that fl part of my title too literally and i thought okay this is it im done i had the day off i wanted to have a good time with my wife we were going to a little beach town nearby and in i think maybe 15 20 minutes i wrote that thing that you just called shakespearean the funny thing is i didnt even realize what a monumental decision it was because five minutes later i read that link to my message back on twitter where people were already discussing on twitter guido resigned as the bdfl and i had posted it on an internal forum that i thought was only read by core developers so i thought i would at least have one day before the news would sort of get out the on your own aspects had also an element of quite it was quite a powerful element of the uncertainty that lies ahead but can you also just briefly talk about for example i play guitar as a hobby for fun and whenever i play people are super positive super friendly theyre like this is awesome this is great but sometimes i enter as an outside observer i enter the programming community and there seems to sometimes be camps on whatever the topic and the two camps the two or plus camps are often pretty harsh at criticizing the opposing camps as an onlooker i may be totally wrong on this but what do you think of this yeah holy wars are sort of a favorite activity in the programming community and what is the psychology behind that is that okay for a healthy community to have is that a productive force ultimately for the evolution of a language well if everybody is patting each other on the back and never telling the truth it would not be a good thing i think there is a middle ground where sort of being nasty to each other is not okay but there is a middle ground where there is healthy ongoing criticism and feedback that is very productive and you mean at every level you see that i mean someone proposes to fix a very small issue in a code base chances are that some reviewer will sort of respond by saying well actually you can do it better the other way when it comes to deciding on the future of the python core developer community we now have i think five or six competing proposals for a constitution so that future do you have a fear of that future do you have a hope for that future im very confident about that future by and large i think that the debate has been very healthy and productive and i actually when i wrote that resignation email i knew that python was in a very good spot and that the python core developer community the group of 50 or 100 people who sort of write or review most of the code that goes into python those people get along very well most of the time a large number of different areas of expertise are represented different levels of experience in the python core dev community different levels of experience completely outside it in software development in general large systems small systems embedded systems so i felt okay resigning because i knew that the community can really take care of itself and out of a grab bag of future feature developments let me ask if you can comment maybe on all very quickly concurrent programming parallel computing async io these are things that people have expressed hope complained about whatever have discussed on reddit async io so the parallelization in general packaging i was totally clueless on this i just used pip to install stuff but apparently theres pipenv poetry theres these dependency packaging systems that manage dependencies and so on theyre emerging and theres a lot of confusion about whats the right thing to use then also functional programming are we going to get more functional programming or not this kind of idea and of course the gil connected to the parallelization i suppose the global interpreter lock problem can you just comment on whichever you want to comment on well lets take the gil and parallelization and async io as one topic im not that hopeful that python will develop into a sort of high concurrency high parallelism language thats sort of the way the language is designed the way most users use the language the way the language is implemented all make that a pretty unlikely future so you think it might not even need to really the way people use it it might not be something that should be of great concern i think async io is a special case because it sort of allows overlapping io and only io and that is a sort of best practice of supporting very high throughput io many connections per second im not worried about that i think async io will evolve there are a couple of competing packages we have some very smart people who are sort of pushing us to make async io better parallel computing i think that python is not the language for that there are ways to work around it but you cant expect to write an algorithm in python and have a compiler automatically parallelize that what you can do is use a package like numpy and there are a bunch of other very powerful packages that sort of use all the cpus available because you tell the package heres the data heres the abstract operation to apply over it go at it and then were back in the c world those packages are themselves implemented usually in c thats where tensorflow and all these packages come in where they parallelize across gpus for example they take care of that for you in terms of packaging can you comment on the future of packaging in python packaging has always been my least favorite topic its a really tough problem because the os and the platform want to own packaging but their packaging solution is not specific to a language if you take linux there are two competing packaging solutions for linux or for unix in general but they all work across all languages several languages like node javascript ruby and python all have their own packaging solutions that only work within the ecosystem of that language what should you use that is a tough problem my own approach is i use the system packaging system to install python and i use the python packaging system then to install third party python packages thats what most people do ten years ago python packaging was really a terrible situation nowadays pip is the future there is a separate ecosystem for numerical and scientific python based on anaconda those two can live together i dont think there is a need for more than that thats packaging well at least for me thats where ive been extremely happy i didnt even know this was an issue until it was brought up in the interest of time let me sort of skip through a million other questions i have so i watched the five and a half hour oral history that youve done with the computer history museum and the nice thing about it it gave this because of the linear progression of the interview it gave this feeling of a life you know a life well lived with interesting things in it sort of a pretty i would say a good spend of this little existence we have on earth so outside of your family looking back what about this journey are you really proud of are there moments that stand out accomplishments ideas is it the creation of python itself that stands out as a thing that you look back and say damn i did pretty good there well i would say that python is definitely the best thing ive ever done and i wouldnt sort of say just the creation of python but the way i sort of raised python like a baby i didnt just conceive a child but i raised a child and now im setting the child free in the world and ive set up the child to sort of be able to take care of himself and im very proud of that and as the announcer of monty pythons flying circus used to say and now for something completely different do you have a favorite monty python moment or a moment in hitchhikers guide or any other literature show or movie that cracks you up when you think about it you can always play me the dead parrot sketch oh thats brilliant thats my favorite as well its pushing up the daisies okay greta thank you so much for talking with me today lex this has been a great conversation i felt i had so much understanding of what actually goes on inside a computer i knew how many bits of memory it had and how difficult it was to program and sort of i didnt believe at all that you could just build something intelligent out of that that would really sort of satisfy my definition of intelligence i think the most influential thing that i read in my early twenties was gödel escherbach that was about consciousness and that was a big eye opener in some sense in what sense so on your own brain did you at the time or do you now see your own brain as a computer or is there a total separation of the way so yeah youre very pragmatically practically know the limits of memory the limits of this sequential computing or weakly paralyzed computing and you just know what we have now and its hard to see how it creates but its also easy to see it was in the 40s 50s 60s and now at least similarities between the brain and our computers oh yeah i mean i totally believe that brains are computers in some sense i mean the rules they use to play by are pretty different from the rules we can sort of implement in our current hardware but i dont believe in like a separate thing that infuses us with intelligence or consciousness or any of that theres no soul ive been an atheist probably from when i was 10 years old just by thinking a bit about math and the universe and well my parents were atheists now i know that you could be an atheist and still believe that there is something sort of about intelligence or consciousness that cannot possibly emerge from a fixed set of rules i am not in that camp i totally see that sort of given how many millions of years evolution took its time dna is a particular machine that sort of encodes information and an unlimited amount of information in chemical form and has figured out a way to replicate itself i thought that that was maybe its 300 million years ago but i thought it was closer to half a billion years ago that thats sort of originated and it hasnt really changed that the sort of the structure of dna hasnt changed ever since that is like our binary code that we have in hardware i mean the basic programming language hasnt changed but maybe the programming itself obviously it did sort of it happened to be a set of rules that was good enough to sort of develop endless variability and sort of the idea of self replicating molecules competing with each other for resources and one type eventually sort of always taking over that happened before there were any fossils so we dont know how that exactly happened but i believe its clear that that did happen can you comment on consciousness and how you see it because i think well talk about programming quite a bit well talk about you know intelligence connecting to programming fundamentally but consciousness is this whole other thing do you think about it often as a developer of a programming language and as a human those are pretty sort of separate topics sort of my line of work working with programming does not involve anything that goes in the direction of developing intelligence or consciousness but sort of privately as an avid reader of popular science writing i have some thoughts which is mostly that i dont actually believe that consciousness is an all or nothing thing i have a feeling that and i forget what i read that influenced this but i feel that if you look at a cat or a dog or a mouse they have some form of intelligence if you look at a fish it has some form of intelligence and that evolution just took a long time but i feel that the sort of evolution of more and more intelligence that led to sort of the human form of intelligence followed the evolution of the senses especially the visual sense i mean there is an enormous amount of processing thats needed to interpret a scene and humans are still better at that than computers are and i have a feeling that there is a sort of the reason that like mammals in particular developed the levels of consciousness that they have and that eventually sort of going from intelligence to self awareness and consciousness has to do with sort of being a robot that has very highly developed senses has a lot of rich sensory information coming in so thats a really interesting thought that whatever that basic mechanism of dna whatever that basic building blocks of programming if you just add more abilities more high resolution sensors more sensors you just keep stacking those things on top that this basic programming in trying to survive develops very interesting things that start to us humans to appear like intelligence and consciousness as far as robots go i think that the self driving cars have that sort of the greatest opportunity of developing something like that because when i drive myself i dont just pay attention to the rules of the road i also look around and i get clues from that oh this is a shopping district oh heres an old lady crossing the street oh here is someone carrying a pile of mail theres a mailbox i bet you theyre going to cross the street to reach that mailbox and i slow down and i dont even think about that and so there is so much where you turn your observations into an understanding of what other consciousnesses are going to do or what other systems in the world are going to be oh that tree is going to fall i see sort of i see much more of i expect somehow that if anything is going to become unconscious its going to be the self driving car and not the network of a bazillion computers in a google or amazon data center that are all networked together to do whatever they do so in that sense so you actually highlight because thats what i work in thomas vehicles you highlight the big gap between what we currently cant do and what we truly need to be able to do to solve the problem under that formulation then consciousness and intelligence is something that basically a system should have in order to interact with us humans as opposed to some kind of abstract notion of a consciousness consciousness is something that you need to have to be able to empathize to be able to fear understand what the fear of death is all these aspects that are important for interacting with pedestrians you need to be able to do basic computation based on our human desires and thoughts and if you sort of yeah if you look at the dog the dog clearly knows i mean im not the dog owner but i have friends who have dogs the dogs clearly know what the humans around them are going to do or at least they have a model of what those humans are going to do and they learn some dogs know when youre going out and they want to go out with you theyre sad when you leave them alone they cry theyre afraid because they were mistreated when they were younger we dont assign sort of consciousness to dogs or at least not all that much but i also dont think they have none of that so i think its consciousness and intelligence are not all or nothing the spectrum is really interesting but in returning to programming languages and the way we think about building these kinds of things about building intelligence building consciousness building artificial beings so i think one of the exciting ideas came in the 17th century and with leibniz hobbes descartes where theres this feeling that you can convert all thought all reasoning all the thing that we find very special in our brains you can convert all of that into logic so you can formalize it formal reasoning and then once you formalize everything all of knowledge then you can just calculate and thats what were doing with our brains is were calculating so theres this whole idea that this is possible that this we can actually program but they werent aware of the concept of pattern matching in the sense that we are aware of it now they sort of thought they had discovered incredible bits of mathematics like newtons calculus and their sort of idealism their sort of extension of what they could do with logic and math sort of went along those lines and they thought theres like yeah logic theres like a bunch of rules and a bunch of input they didnt realize that how you recognize a face is not just a bunch of rules but is a shit ton of data plus a circuit that sort of interprets the visual clues and the context and everything else and somehow can massively parallel pattern match against stored rules i mean if i see you tomorrow here in front of the dropbox office i might recognize you even if im wearing a different shirt yeah but if i see you tomorrow in a coffee shop in belmont i might have no idea that it was you or on the beach or whatever i make those kind of mistakes myself all the time i see someone that i only know as like oh this person is a colleague of my wifes and then i see them at the movies and i didnt recognize them but do you see those you call it pattern matching do you see that rules is unable to encode that everything you see all the pieces of information you look around this room im wearing a black shirt i have a certain height im a human all these theres probably tens of thousands of facts you pick up moment by moment about this scene you take them for granted and you aggregate them together to understand the scene you dont think all of that could be encoded to where at the end of the day you can just put it all on the table and calculate i dont know what that means i mean yes in the sense that there is no actual magic there but there are enough layers of abstraction from the facts as they enter my eyes and my ears to the understanding of the scene that i dont think that ai has really covered enough of that distance its like if you take a human body and you realize its built out of atoms well that is a uselessly reductionist view right the body is built out of organs the organs are built out of cells the cells are built out of proteins the proteins are built out of amino acids the amino acids are built out of atoms and then you get to quantum mechanics so thats a very pragmatic view i mean obviously as an engineer i agree with that kind of view but you also have to consider the sam harris view of well intelligence is just information processing like you said you take in sensory information you do some stuff with it and you come up with actions that are intelligent that makes it sound so easy i dont know who sam harris is oh well its a philosopher so like this is how philosophers often think right and essentially thats what descartes was is wait a minute if there is like you said no magic so he basically says it doesnt appear like theres any magic but we know so little about it that it might as well be magic so just because we know that were made of atoms just because we know were made of organs the fact that we know very little how to get from the atoms to organs in a way thats recreatable means that you shouldnt get too excited just yet about the fact that you figured out that were made of atoms right and the same about taking facts as our sensory organs take them in and turning that into reasons and actions that sort of there are a lot of abstractions that we havent quite figured out how to deal with those i mean sometimes i dont know if i can go on a tangent or not so if i take a simple program that parses say i have a compiler that parses a program in a sense the input routine of that compiler of that parser is a sensing organ and it builds up a mighty complicated internal representation of the program it just saw it doesnt just have a linear sequence of bytes representing the text of the program anymore it has an abstract syntax tree and i dont know how many of your viewers or listeners are familiar with compiler technology but theres… fewer and fewer these days right thats also true probably people want to take a shortcut but theres sort of this abstraction is a data structure that the compiler then uses to produce outputs that is relevant like a translation of that program to machine code that can be executed by hardware and then that data structure gets thrown away when a fish or a fly sees sort of gets visual impulses im sure it also builds up some data structure and for the fly that may be very minimal a fly may have only a few i mean in the case of a flys brain i could imagine that there are few enough layers of abstraction that its not much more than when its darker here than it is here well it can sense motion because a fly sort of responds when you move your arm towards it so clearly its visual processing is intelligent well not intelligent but it has an abstraction for motion and we still have similar things in but much more complicated in our brains i mean otherwise you couldnt drive a car if you couldnt if you didnt have an incredibly good abstraction for motion yeah in some sense the same abstraction for motion is probably one of the primary sources of our of information for us we just know what to do i think we know what to do with that weve built up other abstractions on top we build much more complicated data structures based on that and we build more persistent data structures sort of after some processing some information sort of gets stored in our memory pretty much permanently and is available on recall i mean there are some things that you sort of youre conscious that youre remembering it like you give me your phone number i well at my age i have to write it down but i could imagine i could remember those seven numbers or ten digits and reproduce them in a while if i sort of repeat them to myself a few times so thats a fairly conscious form of memorization on the other hand how do i recognize your face i have no idea my brain has a whole bunch of specialized hardware that knows how to recognize faces i dont know how much of that is sort of coded in our dna and how much of that is trained over and over between the ages of zero and three but somehow our brains know how to do lots of things like that that are useful in our interactions with other humans without really being conscious of how its done anymore right so our actual day to day lives were operating at the very highest level of abstraction were just not even conscious of all the little details underlying it theres compilers on top of its like turtles on top of turtles or turtles all the way down theres compilers all the way down but thats essentially you say that theres no magic thats what i what i was trying to get at i think is with descartes started this whole train of saying that theres no magic i mean theres all this beforehand well didnt descartes also have the notion though that the soul and the body were fundamentally separate separate yeah i think he had to write in god in there for political reasons so i dont know actually im not a historian but theres notions in there that all of reasoning all of human thought can be formalized i think that continued in the 20th century with russell and with gadots incompleteness theorem this debate of what are the limits of the things that could be formalized thats where the turing machine came along and this exciting idea i mean underlying a lot of computing that you can do quite a lot with a computer you can encode a lot of the stuff were talking about in terms of recognizing faces and so on theoretically in an algorithm that can then run on a computer and in that context id like to ask programming in a philosophical way what does it mean to program a computer so you said you write a python program or compiled a c program that compiles to some byte code its forming layers youre programming a layer of abstraction thats higher how do you see programming in that context can it keep getting higher and higher levels of abstraction i think at some point the higher levels of abstraction will not be called programming and they will not resemble what we call programming at the moment there will not be source code i mean there will still be source code sort of at a lower level of the machine just like there are still molecules and electrons and sort of proteins in our brains but and so theres still programming and system administration and who knows what to keep the machine running but what the machine does is a different level of abstraction in a sense and as far as i understand the way that for the last decade or more people have made progress with things like facial recognition or the self driving cars is all by endless endless amounts of training data where at least as a lay person and i feel myself totally as a lay person in that field it looks like the researchers who publish the results dont necessarily know exactly how their algorithms work and i often get upset when i sort of read a sort of a fluff piece about facebook in the newspaper or social networks and they say well algorithms and thats like a totally different interpretation of the word algorithm because for me the way i was trained or what i learned when i was eight or ten years old an algorithm is a set of rules that you completely understand that can be mathematically analyzed and you can prove things you can like prove that aristotelian sieve produces all prime numbers and only prime numbers yeah so i dont know if you know who andrej karpathy is im afraid not so hes a head of ai at tesla now but he was at stanford before and he has this cheeky way of calling this concept software 20 so let me disentangle that for a second so kind of what youre referring to is the traditional the algorithm the concept of an algorithm something thats there its clear you can read it you understand it you can prove its functioning as kind of software 10 and what software 20 is is exactly what you described which is you have neural networks which is a type of machine learning that you feed a bunch of data and that neural network learns to do a function all you specify is the inputs and the outputs you want and you cant look inside you cant analyze it all you can do is train this function to map the inputs to the outputs by giving a lot of data and thats as programming becomes getting a lot of data thats what programming is well that would be programming 20 to programming 20 i wouldnt call that programming its just a different activity just like building organs out of cells is not called chemistry well so lets just step back and think sort of more generally of course but you know its like as a parent teaching your kids things can be called programming in that same sense thats how programming is being used youre providing them data examples use cases so imagine writing a function not by not with for loops and clearly readable text but more saying well heres a lot of examples of what this function should take and heres a lot of examples of when it takes those functions it should do this and then figure out the rest so thats the 20 concept and so the question i have for you is like its a very fuzzy way this is the reality of a lot of these pattern recognition systems and so on its a fuzzy way of quote unquote programming what do you think about this kind of world should it be called something totally different than programming if youre a software engineer does that mean youre designing systems that are very can be systematically tested evaluated they have a very specific specification and then this other fuzzy software 20 world machine learning world thats something else totally or is there some intermixing thats possible well the question is probably only being asked because we dont quite know what that software 20 actually is and i think there is a truism that every task that ai has tackled in the past at some point we realized how it was done and then it was no longer considered part of artificial intelligence because it was no longer necessary to use that term it was just oh now we know how to do this and a new field of science or engineering has been developed and i dont know if sort of every form of learning or sort of controlling computer systems should always be called programming so i dont know maybe im focused too much on the terminology but i expect that there just will be different concepts where people with sort of different education and a different model of what theyre trying to do will develop those concepts i guess if you could comment on another way to put this concept is i think the kind of functions that neural networks provide is things as opposed to being able to upfront prove that this should work for all cases you throw at it all youre able its the worst case analysis versus average case analysis all youre able to say is it seems on everything weve tested to work 999 of the time but we cant guarantee it and it fails in unexpected ways we cant even give you examples of how it fails in unexpected ways but its like really good most of the time is there no room for that in current ways we think about programming programming 10 is actually sort of getting to that point too where the sort of the ideal of a bug free program has been abandoned long ago by most software developers we only care about bugs that manifest themselves often enough to be annoying and were willing to take the occasional crash or outage or incorrect result for granted because we cant possibly we dont have enough programmers to make all the code bug free and it would be an incredibly tedious business and if you try to throw formal methods at it it becomes even more tedious so every once in a while the user clicks on a link and somehow they get an error and the average user doesnt panic they just click again and see if it works better the second time which often magically it does or they go up and they try some other way of performing their tasks so thats sort of an end to end recovery mechanism and inside systems there is all sorts of retries and timeouts and fallbacks and i imagine that that sort of biological systems are even more full of that because otherwise they wouldnt survive do you think programming should be taught and thought of as exactly what you just said i come from this kind of youre always denying that fact always in sort of basic programming education the sort of the programs youre having students write are so small and simple that if there is a bug you can always find it and fix it because the sort of programming as its being taught in some even elementary middle schools in high school introduction to programming classes in college typically its programming in the small very few classes sort of actually teach software engineering building large systems every summer here at dropbox we have a large number of interns every tech company on the west coast has the same thing these interns are always amazed because this is the first time in their life that they see what goes on in a really large software development environment everything theyve learned in college was almost always about a much smaller scale and somehow that difference in scale makes a qualitative difference in how you do things and how you think about it if you then take a few steps back into decades 70s and 80s when you were first thinking about python or just that world of programming languages did you ever think that there would be systems as large as underlying google facebook and dropbox did you when you were thinking about python i was actually always caught by surprise by sort of this yeah pretty much every stage of computing so maybe just because youve spoken in other interviews but i think the evolution of programming languages are fascinating and its especially because it leads from my perspective towards greater and greater degrees of intelligence i learned the first programming language i played with in russia was with the turtle logo logo yeah and if you look i just have a list of programming languages all of which ive now played with a little bit i mean theyre all beautiful in different ways from fortran cobalt lisp algol 60 basic logo again c as a few the object oriented came along in the 60s simula pascal smalltalk all of that leads theyre all the classics the classics yeah the classic hits right steam thats built on top of lisp on the database side sql c and all of that leads up to python pascal too and thats before python matlab these kind of different communities different languages so can you talk about that world i know that sort of python came out of abc which i actually never knew that language i just having researched this conversation went back to abc and it looks remarkably it has a lot of annoying qualities but underneath those like all caps and so on but underneath that theres elements of python that are quite theyre already there thats where i got all the good stuff all the good stuff so but in that world youre swimming these programming languages were you focused on just the good stuff in your specific circle or did you have a sense of what is everyone chasing you said that every programming language is built to scratch an itch were you aware of all the itches in the community and if not or if yes i mean what itch were you trying to scratch with python well im glad i wasnt aware of all the itches because i would probably not have been able to do anything i mean if youre trying to solve every problem at once youll solve nothing well yeah its too overwhelming and so i had a very very focused problem i wanted a programming language that sat somewhere in between shell scripting and c and now arguably there is like one is higher level one is lower level and python is sort of a language of an intermediate level although its still pretty much at the high level end i was thinking about much more about i want a tool that i can use to be more productive as a programmer in a very specific environment and i also had given myself a time budget for the development of the tool and that was sort of about three months for both the design like thinking through what are all the features of the language syntactically and semantically and how do i implement the whole pipeline from parsing the source code to executing it so i think both with the timeline and the goals it seems like productivity was at the core of it as a goal so like for me in the 90s and the first decade of the 21st century i was always doing machine learning ai programming for my research was always in c and then the other people who are a little more mechanical engineering electrical engineering are matlabby theyre a little bit more matlab focused those are the world and maybe a little bit java too but people who are more interested in emphasizing the object oriented nature of things so within the last 10 years or so especially with the oncoming of neural networks and these packages that are built on python to interface with neural networks i switched to python and its just ive noticed a significant boost that i cant exactly because i dont think about it but i cant exactly put into words why im just much much more productive just being able to get the job done much much faster so how do you think whatever that qualitative difference is i dont know if its quantitative it could be just a feeling i dont know if im actually more productive but how do you think about you probably are yeah well thats right i think theres elements let me just speak to one aspect that i think that was affecting my productivity is c was i really enjoyed creating performant code and creating a beautiful structure where everything that you know this kind of going into this especially with the newer and newer standards of templated programming of just really creating this beautiful formal structure that i found myself spending most of my time doing that as opposed to getting it parsing a file and extracting a few keywords or whatever the task was trying to do so what is it about python how do you think of productivity in general as you were designing it now sort of through the decades last three decades what do you think it means to be a productive programmer', 'the following is a conversation with jeff atwood he is the cofounder of stack overflow and stack exchange websites that are visited by millions of people every single day much like with wikipedia it is difficult to understate the impact on global knowledge and productivity that these networks of sites have created jeff is also the author of the famed blog coding horror and the founder of discourse an open source software project that seeks to improve the quality of our online community discussions this conversation is part of the mit course on artificial general intelligence and the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it subscribe on youtube itunes or your podcast provider of choice or simply connect with me on twitter at lex friedman spelled f r i d and now heres my conversation with jeff atwood having co created and managed for a few years the worlds largest community of programmers in stack overflow 10 years ago what do you think motivates most programmers is it fame fortune glory process of programming itself or is it the sense of belonging to a community its puzzles really i think its this idea of working on puzzles independently of other people and just solving a problem sort of like on your own almost although nobody really works alone in programming anymore but i will say theres an aspect of hiding yourself away and just beating on a problem until you solve it like brute force basically to me is what a lot of programming is the computers so fast that you can do things that would take forever for a human but you can just do them so many times and so often that you get the answer youre saying just the pure act of tinkering with the code is the thing that drives most problems the struggle balance within the joy of overcoming the brute force process of pain and suffering that eventually leads to something that actually works well datas fun too theres this thing called the shuffling problem the naive shuffle that most programmers write has a huge flaw and theres a lot of articles online about this because it can be really bad if youre a casino and you have an unsophisticated programmer writing your shuffle algorithm theres surprising ways to get this wrong but the neat thing is the way to figure that out is just to run your shuffle a bunch of times and see how many orientations of cards you get you should get an equal distribution of all the cards and with the naive method of shuffling if you just look at the data if you just brute force it and say ok i dont know whats going to happen you just write a program that does it a billion times and then see what the buckets look like of the data and the monty hall problem is another example of that where you have three doors and somebody gives you information about another door so the correct answer is you should always switch in the monty hall problem which is not intuitive and it freaks people out all the time but you can solve it with data if you write a program that does the monty hall game and then never switches then always switches just compare you would immediately see that you dont have to be smart you dont have to figure out the answer algorithmically you can just brute force it out with data and say well i know the answer is this because i ran the program a billion times and these are the data buckets that i got from it so empirically find it but whats the joy of that so for you for you personally outside of family what motivates you in this process well to be honest i dont really write a lot of code anymore what i do at discourse is managery stuff which i always despised as a programmer you think of managers as people who dont really do anything themselves but the weird thing about code is you realize that language is code the ability to direct other people lets you get more stuff done than you could by yourself anyway you said language is code language is code meaning communication with other humans yes it is you can think of it as a systematic so what is it like to be what makes before we get into programming what makes a good manager what makes a good leader well i think a leader its all about leading by example first of all sort of doing and being the things that you want to be now this can be kind of exhausting particularly when you have kids because you realize that your kids are watching you all the time even in ways that youve stopped seeing yourself the hardest person to see on the planet is really yourself its a lot easier to see other people and make judgments about them but yourself youre super biased you dont actually see yourself the way other people see you often youre very very hard on yourself in a way that other people really arent going to be so thats one of the insights is youve got to be really diligent about thinking am i behaving in a way that represents how i want other people to behave like leading through example theres a lot of examples of leaders that really mess this up like they make decisions that are like wow its a bad example for other people so i think leading by example is one the other one i believe is working really hard and i dont mean working exhaustively but showing a real passion for the problem not necessarily your solution to the problem but the problem itself is just one that you really believe in like with discourse for example the problem that were looking at which is my current project is how do you get people in groups to communicate in a way that doesnt break down into the howling of wolves how do you deal with trolling not like technical problems how do i get people to post paragraphs how do i get people to use bold how do i get people to use complete sentences although those are problems as well but how do i get people to get along with each other and then solve whatever problem it is they set out to solve or reach some consensus on discussion or just not hurt each other even maybe its a discussion that doesnt really matter but are people yelling at each other and why like thats not the purpose of this kind of communication so i would say leadership is about setting an example doing the things that represent what you want to be and making sure that youre actually doing those things and theres a trick to that too because the things you dont do also say a lot about what you are yeah so lets pause on that one so those two things are fascinating so how do you have as a leader that self awareness so you just said its really hard to be self aware so for you personally or maybe for other leaders youve seen or look up to how do you know both that the things youre doing are the wrong things to be doing the way you speak to others the way you behave and the things youre not doing how do you get that signal i think theres two aspects to that one is like processing feedback that youre getting so how do you get feedback well right so are you getting feedback right so one way we do it for example with discourse we have three cofounders and we periodically talk about decisions before we make them so its not like one person can make a mistake or like wow there can be misunderstandings things like that so its part of like group consensus of leadership is like its good to have i think systems where theres one leader and that leader has the rule of absolute law are just really dangerous in my experience for communities for example like if you have a community thats run by one person that one person makes all the decisions that persons gonna have a bad day something could happen to that person something theres a lot of variables so like first when you think about leadership have multiple people doing leadership and have them talk amongst each other so giving each other feedback about the decisions that theyre making and then when you do get feedback i think theres that little voice in your head right or your gut or wherever you wanna put it in your body i think that voice is really important like i think most people who have any kind of moral compass or like want to do most people want to do the right thing i do believe that i mean there might be a handful of sociopaths out there that dont but most people they want other people to think of them as a good person and why wouldnt you right like do you want people to despise you i mean thats just weird right so you have that little voice that sort of the angel and devil on your shoulder sort of talking to you about like what youre doing how youre doing how does it make you feel to make these decisions right and i think having some attunement to that voice is important but you said that voice also for i think this is a programmer situation too where sometimes the devil on the shoulder is a little too loud so youre a little too self critical for a lot of developers and especially when you have introverted personality how do you struggle with a self criticism or the criticism of others so one of the things of leadership is to do something thats potentially unpopular or where people doubt you and you still go through with the decision so whats that balance like i think you have to walk people through your decision making right like you have to this is where blogging is really important and communication is so important again code language is just another kind of code its like here is the program by which i arrived at the conclusion that im gonna reach right its one thing to say like this is a decision its final deal with it right thats not usually satisfying to people but if you say look weve been thinking about this problem for a while heres some stuff thats happened heres what we think is right heres our goals heres what we wanna achieve and weve looked at these options and we think this available options is the best option people will be like oh okay right maybe i dont totally agree with you but i can kind of see where youre coming from and i see its not just arbitrary decision delivered from a cloud of flames in the sky right its like a human trying to reach some kind of consensus about goals and their goals might be different than yours thats completely legit right but if youre making that clear its like oh well the reason we dont agree is because we have totally different goals right like how could we agree its not that youre a bad person its that we have radically different goals in mind when we started looking at this problem and the other one you said is passion so or hard work sorry well those are tied together in my mind lets say hard work and passion like for me like i just really love the problem discourse is setting out to solve because in a way its like theres a vision of the world where it all devolves into facebook basically owning everything and every aspect of human communication right and this has always been kind of a scary world for me first cause i dont i think facebook is really good at execution i got to compliment them theyre very competent in terms of what theyre doing but facebook has not much of a moral compass in terms of facebook cares about facebook really they dont really care about you and your problems what they care about is how big they can make facebook right is that you talking about the company or just the mechanism of how facebook works kind of both really right like and the idea with discourse the reason im so passionate about it is cause i believe every community should have the right to own themselves right like they should have their own software that they can run that belongs to them thats their space where they can set the rules and if they dont like it they can move to different hosting or you know whatever they need to happen can happen but like this idea of a company town where all human communication is implicitly owned by whatsapp instagram and facebook and its really disturbing too cause facebook is really smart like i said theyre great at execution buying in whatsapp and buying instagram were incredibly smart decisions and they also do this thing i dont know if you know but they have this vpn software that they give away for free on smartphones and it indirectly feeds all the data about the traffic back to facebook so they can see whats actually getting popular through the vpns right they have low level access to the network data because users have let them have that so so lets take a small pause here first of all discourse can you talk about can you lay out the land of all the different ways you can have communities so theres stack overflow that youve built theres discourse so stack overflow is kind of like a wiki wikipedia you talk about and its a very specific scalpel very focused so what is the purpose of discourse and maybe contrast that with facebook first of all say what is discourse yeah start from the beginning well let me start from the very beginning so stack overflow is a very structured wiki style q and a for programmers right and that was the problem we first worked on and when we started we thought it was discussions because we looked at like programming forums and other things but we quickly realized we were doing q and a which is a very narrow subset of human communication right sorry so when you started stack overflow you thought you didnt even know the q and a not really you didnt know it would be q and a well we didnt know we had an idea of like okay these are things that we see working online we had a goal right our goal was there was this site experts exchange with a very unfortunate name thank you for killing that site yeah i know right like a lot of people dont remember it anymore which is great like thats the measure of success when people dont remember the thing that you were trying to replace then youve totally won so it was a place to get answers to programming questions but it wasnt clear if it was like focused q and a if it was a discussion there were plenty of programming forums so we werent really sure we were like okay well take aspects of dig and reddit like voting were very important reordering answers based on votes wiki style stuff of like being able to edit posts not just your posts but other peoples posts to make them better and keep them more up to date ownership of blogging of like okay this is me im saying this in my voice this is the stuff that i know and your reputation accrues to you and its peer recognition so you asked earlier like what motivates programmers i think peer recognition motivates them a lot that was one of the key insights of stack overflow was like recognition from your peers is why things get done not necessarily money not necessarily your boss but like your peers saying wow this person really knows their stuff has a lot of value so the reputation system came from that so we were sort of frankensteining a bunch of stuff together in stack overflow like stuff we had seen working and we knew worked and that became stack overflow over time we realized it wasnt really discussion it was very focused questions and answers there wasnt a lot of room on the page for let me talk about this tangential thing it was more like okay is it answering the question is it clarifying the question or could it be an alternative answer to the same question because theres usually more than one way to do it in programming theres like say five to 10 ways and one of the patterns we got into early on with stack overflow was there were questions where there would be like hundreds of answers and were like wow how can there be a programming question with 500 200 500 answers and we looked at those and we realized those were not really questions in the traditional sense they were discussions it was stuff that we allowed early on that we eventually decided wasnt allowed such as whats your favorite programming food whats the funniest programming cartoon youve seen and we had to sort of backfill a bunch of rules about like why isnt this allowed such as is this a real problem youre facing like nobody goes to work and says wow i cant work cause i dont know what the funniest programming cartoon is so sorry cant compile this code now right its not a real problem youre facing in your job so that was run rule and the second like what can you really learn from that its like what i call accidental learning or reddit style learning where youre just like oh ill just browse some things and oh wow you know did you know tree frogs only live three years i mean i just made that up i dont know if thats true but i didnt really set out to learn that i dont need to know that right its accidental learning it was more intentional learning where youre like okay i have a problem and i want to learn about stuff around this problem having right and it could be theory it could be compiler theory it could be other stuff but im having a compiler problem hence i need to know the compiler theory that aspect of it that gets me to my answer right so kind of a directed learning so we had to backfill all these rules as we sort of figured out what the heck it was we were doing and the system came very strict over time and a lot of people still complain about that and i wrote my latest blog entry what does stack overflow want to be when it grows up celebrating the 10 year anniversary yeah yeah so 10 years and the system has trended towards strictness theres a variety of reasons for this one is people dont like to see other people get reputation for stuff as they view as frivolous which i can actually understand because if you saw a programmer got like 500 upvotes for funniest programming cartoon or funniest comment they had seen in code its like well why do they have that reputation is it because they wrote the joke probably not i mean if they did maybe or the cartoon right theyre getting a bunch of reputation based on someone elses work thats not even programming its just a joke right its related to programming so you begin to resent that youre like well thats not fair and it isnt at some level theyre correct i mean i empathize because its not correct to get reputation for that versus heres a really gnarly regular expression problem and heres a really clever insightful detailed answer laying out oh heres why youre seeing the behavior that youre seeing here let me teach you some things about how to avoid that in the future thats great thats gold right you want people to get reputation for that not so much for wow look at this funny thing i saw right great so theres this very specific qa format and then take me through the journey towards discourse and facebook and twitter so you started at the beginning that stack overflow evolved to have a purpose so what is discourse this passion you have for creating community for discussion when was that born and how well part of it is based on the realization that stack overflow is only good for very specific subjects where its based on data facts and science where answers can be kind of verified to be true another form of that is theres the book of knowledge like the tome of knowledge that defines whatever it is you can refer to that book and itll give you the answer there has to be it only works on subjects where theres like semi clear answers to things that can be verified in some form now again theres always more than one way to do it theres complete flexibility and system around that but where it falls down is stuff like poker and lego like we had if you go to stackexchangecom we have an engine that tries to launch different qa topics right and people can propose qa topics sample questions and if it gets enough support within the network we launched that qa site so some of the ones we launched were poker and lego and they did horribly right because i mean they might still be there lingering on in some form but it was an experiment this is like a test right and some subjects work super well on the stack engine and some dont but the reason lego and poker dont work is because theyre so social really its not about whats the rule here in poker its like well what kind of cigars do we like to smoke while playing poker or whats a cool set of cards to use when im playing poker or whats some strategies say i have this hand come up with some strategies i could use its more of a discussion around whats happening with lego same thing heres this cool lego set i found look how awesome this is and im like yeah thats freaking awesome right its not a question right theres all these social components and discussions that dont fit at all we literally have to disallow those in stack overflow because its not about being social its about problems that youre facing in your work that you need concrete answers for you have a real demonstrated problem thats blocking you in something nobodys blocked by what should i do when i have a straight flush its not a blocking problem in the world its just an opportunity to hang out and discuss so discourse was a way to address that and say look discussion forum software was very very bad and when i came out of stack overflow in early 2012 it was still very very bad i expected it improved in the four years since i last looked but it had not improved at all and i was like well thats kind of terrible because i love these communities of people talking about things that they love theyre just communities of interest right and theres no good software for them startups would come to me and say hey jeff i want to have this startup heres my idea and the first thing i would say to them is well first why are you asking me i dont really know your field necessarily why arent you asking the community the people that are interested in this problem the people that are using your product why arent you talking to them and then theyd say oh great idea how do i do that and then thats when i started playing sad trombone because i realized all the software involving talking to your users customers audience patrons whatever it is it was all really bad it was stuff that i would be embarrassed to recommend to other people and yet thats where i felt they could get the biggest and strongest most effective input for what they should be doing with their product right its from their users from their community right thats what we did on stack overflow so what were talking about with forums the what is it the dark matter of the internet its still i dont know if its still but for the longest time it has some of the most passionate and fascinating discussions and whats the usual structure theres usually its linear so its sequential so youre posting one after the other and theres pagination so its every theres 10 posts and then you go to the next page and that format still is used by like im were doing a lot of research with tesla vehicles and theres a tesla motors club forum which is extremely we really wanted to run that actually they pinged us about it i dont think we got it but i really would have liked to gotten that one but theyve started before even 2012 i believe its like you dont want a heartbeat thats like so fast its like youre just freaking out but it is a measure of health you should have a healthy heartbeat its up to people listening to decide what that means but it has to be healthy it has to be reasonable because otherwise youre just going to be frustrated because thats how you build software you make mistakes you roll it out you live with it you see what it feels like and say oh god that was a terrible idea oh my gosh this could be even better if we did y right you turn the crank and then the more you do that the faster you get ahead of your competitors ultimately its rate of change right delta v right how fast are you moving well within a year youre going to be miles away by the time they catch up with you right thats the way it works and plus as a software developer and user i love software thats constantly changing because i dont understand people who get super pissed off when like oh they changed the software on me how dare they im like yes change the software change it all the time man thats what makes this stuff great is that it can be changed so rapidly and become something that is greater than it is now now granted there are some changes that suck i admit ive seen it many times but in general thats what makes software cool right its that it is so malleable fighting that is weird to me because its like well youre fighting the essence of the thing that youre building that doesnt make sense you want to really embrace that not to be a hummingbird but embrace it to a healthy cycle of your heartbeat right so you talk about that people really dont change its true thats why probably a lot of the stuff you write about in your blog probably will remain true well theres a flip side of the coin people dont change like investing and understanding people is like learning unix in 1970 because nothing has changed right all those things youve learned about people will still be valid 34 years from now whereas if you learn the latest javascript framework thats going to be good for like two years right exactly but if you look at the future of programming so theres a people component but theres also the technology itself what do you see as the future of programming will it change significantly or as far as you can tell people are ultimately programming and so its not something that you foresee changing in any fundamental way well youve got to go look back on sort of the basics of programming and one of things that always shocked me is like source control like i didnt learn anything about source control granted i graduated from college in 1992 but i remember hearing from people as late as like 1998 1999 like even maybe today theyre not learning source control and to me its like well how can you not learn source control that is so fundamental to working with other programmers working in a way that you dont lose your work just basic software the literal bedrock of software development is source control now you compare it today like github right like microsoft bought github which i think was an incredibly smart acquisition move on their part now they have anybody who wants reasonable source control to go sign up on github its all set up for you right theres tons of walkthroughs tons of tutorials so from the concept of like has programming advanced from say 1999 its like well hell we have github i mean my god yes right like its massively advanced over what it was now as to whether programming is significantly different im going to say no but i think the baseline of what we view as fundamentals will continue to go up and actually get better like source control thats one of the fundamentals that has gotten hundreds of orders of magnitude better than it was 10 20 years ago so those are the fundamentals let me introduce two things that maybe you can comment on so one is mobile phones so that could fundamentally transform what programming is or maybe not maybe you can comment on that and the other one is artificial intelligence which promises to in some ways to do some of the programming for you is one way to think about it so its really what a programmer is is using the intelligence thats inside your skull to do something useful the hope with artificial intelligence is that it does some of the useful parts for you where you dont have to think about it so do you see smartphones the fact that everybody has one and theyre getting more and more powerful as potentially changing programming and do you see ai as potentially changing programming ok so thats good so smartphones have definitely changed i mean since i guess 2010 is when they really started getting super popular i mean in the last eight years the world has literally changed right everybody carries a computer around and thats normal i mean that is such a huge change in society i think were still dealing with a lot of the positive and negative ramifications of that right everybodys connected all the time everybodys on the computer all the time that was my dream world as a geek right but its like be careful what you ask for right like wow now everybody has a computer its not quite the utopia that we thought it would be right computers can be used for a lot of stuff thats not necessarily great so to me thats the central focus of the smartphone is just that it puts a computer in front of everyone granted a small touch screen smallish touch screen computer but as for programming i dont know i dont think that ive kind of over time come to subscribe to the unix view of the world when it comes to programming you want to teach these basic command line things and that is just what programming is going to be for i think a long long time i dont think theres any magical visual programming thats going to happen i dont know ive over time have become a believer in that unix philosophy of just you know they kind of had to write with unix thats going to be the way it is for a long long time and well continue to like i said raise the baseline the tools will get better itll get simpler but its still fundamentally going to be command line tools fancy ides thats kind of it for the foreseeable future im not seeing any visual programming stuff on the horizon because you kind of think like what do you do on a smartphone that will be directly analogous to programming like im trying to think right and theres really not much so not necessarily analogous to programming but the kind of things that the kind of programs you would need to write might need to be very different yeah and the kind of languages i mean but i probably also subscribe to the same just because everything in this world might be written in javascript oh yeah thats already happening i mean discourse is a bet discourse itself javascript is another bet on that side of the table and i still try and believe in that so i would say smartphones have mostly a cultural shift more than a programming shift now your other question was about artificial intelligence and sort of devices predicting what youre going to do and i do think theres some strength to that i think artificial intelligence is kind of overselling it in terms of what its doing its more like people are predictable right people do the same things let me give you an example one check we put in a discourse thats been a lot of big commercial websites is say you log in from new york city now and then an hour later you log in from san francisco its like well hmm thats interesting how did you get from new york to san francisco in one hour so at that point youre like ok this is a suspicious login at that point so we would alert you its like ok but thats not ai right thats just a heuristic of like how did you in one hour get 2000 miles right that doesnt i mean youre grand maybe youre on a vpn theres other ways to happen thats just a basic prediction based on the idea that people pretty much dont move around that much they may travel occasionally but nobody unless youre a traveling salesman thats literally traveling the world every day theres so much repetition and predictability in terms of things youre going to do and i think good software anticipates your needs for example google i think its called google now or whatever that google thing is that predicts your commute and predicts based on your phone location where are you every day well thats probably where you work that kind of stuff i do think computers can get a lot better at that i hesitate to call it full blown ai its just computers getting better at like first of all they have a ton of data because everybody has a smartphone now all of a sudden we have all this data that we didnt have before about location about communication and feeding that into some basic heuristics and maybe some fancy algorithms that turn it into predictions of anticipating your needs like a friend would right like oh hey i see your home would you like some dinner right like lets go get some food because thats usually what we do at this time of day right in the context of actually the act of programming do you see ides improving and making the life of programming as better i do think that is possible because theres a lot of repetition in programming right oh you know clippy would be the bad example of oh i see it looks like youre writing a for loop but there are patterns in code right and actually libraries are kind of like that right rather than go code up your own http request library its like well youd use one of the existing ones that we have thats already a troubleshot right its not ai per se its just building better lego bricks bigger lego bricks that have more functionality in them so people dont have to worry about the low level stuff as much anymore like wordpress for example to me is like a tool for somebody who isnt a programmer to do something i mean you can turn wordpress into anything its kind of crazy actually through plugins right and thats not programming per se its just lego bricks stacking wordpress elements right and a little bit of configuration glue so i would say maybe in a broader sense what im seeing like therell be more gluing and less actual programming and thats a good thing right because most of the stuff you need is kind of out there already you said 1970s unix do you see php and these kind of old remnants of the early birth of programming remaining with us for a long time like you said unix in itself do you see ultimately this stuff just being there out of momentum i kind of do i mean i was a big believer in windows early on and i was a big you know i was like unix what a waste of time but over time ive completely flipped on that where i was like okay the unix guys were right and pretty much microsoft and windows were kind of wrong at least on the server side now on the desktop right you need a gui you need all that stuff and you have the two philosophies like apple built on unix effectively darwin and on the desktop its a slightly different story but on the server side where youre gonna be programming now its a question of where the programmings gonna be theres gonna be a lot more like client side programming because technically discourse is client side programming the way you get discourse we deliver a big ball of javascript which is then executed locally so were really using a lot more local computing power well still retrieve the data obviously we have to display the posts on the screen and so forth but in terms of like sorting and a lot of the basic stuff were using the host processor but to the extent that a lot of programming is still gonna be server side i would say yeah the unix philosophy definitely won and therell be different veneers over unix but its still if you peel away one or two layers its gonna be unixy for a long i think unix won i mean so definitively its interesting to hear you say that because youve done so much excellent work on the microsoft side in terms of backend development cool so whats the future hold for jeff atwood i mean the discourse continuing the discourse in trying to improve conversation on the web well discourse is what ive viewed as a and originally i called it a five year project then really quickly revised that to a 10 year project so we started in early 2013 thats when we launched the first version so were still five years in this is the part where it starts getting good like we have a good product now discourse theres any project you build in software it takes three years to build what you want it to build anyway like v1 is gonna be terrible which it was but you ship it anyway because thats how you get better at stuff its about turning the crank its not about v1 being perfect because thats ridiculous its about v1 then lets get really good at v11 12 13 like how fast can we iterate and i think were iterating like crazy on discourse to the point that like its a really good product now we have serious momentum and my original vision was i wanna be the wordpress of discussion meaning someone came to you and said i wanna start a blog although the very question is kind of archaic now its like who actually blogs anymore but i wanted the answer to that to be it would be wordpress normally because thats the obvious choice for blogging most of the time but if someone said hey i need a group of people to get together and do something the answer should be discourse right that should be the default answer for people because its open source its free doesnt cost you anything you control it you can run it your minimum server cost for discourse is five bucks a month at this point they actually got the vps prices down it used to be 10 a month for one gigabyte of ram which we have a kind of heavy stack like theres a lot of stuff in discourse you need postgres you need redis you need ruby and rails you need a sidekick for scheduling its not a trivial amount of stuff because we were architected for like look were building for the next 10 years i dont care about shared php hosting thats not my model my idea is like hey eventually this is gonna be very cheap for everybody and i wanna build it right using again higher bigger building block levels right that have more requirements and theres a wordpress model of wordpressorg wordpresscom is there a central hosting for discourse or no there is were not strictly segmenting into the open source versus the commercial side we have a hosting business thats how discourse makes money is we host discourse instances and we have really close relationship with our customers of the symbiosis of them giving us feedback on the product we definitely wait feedback from customers a lot heavier than feedback from somebody who just wanders by and gives feedback but thats where we make all our money but we dont have a strict division we encourage people to use discourse like the whole point is that its free right anybody can set it up i dont wanna be the only person that hosts discourse thats absolutely not the goal but it is a primary way for us to build a business and its actually kind of a great business i mean the business is going really really well in terms of hosting so i used to work at google research its a company thats basically funded on advertisements so its facebook let me ask if you can comment on it i think advertisement is best so youd be extremely critical on what ads are but at its best its actually serving you in a sense its giving you its connecting you to what you would want to explore so its like related posts or related content its the same thats the best of advertisement so discourse is connecting people based on their interests it seems like a place where advertisement at its best could actually serve the users is that something that youre considering thinking about as a way to bring to financially support the platform thats interesting because i actually have a contrarian view of advertising which i kind of agree with you i recently installed adblocker reluctantly because i dont like to do that but the performance of the ads man theyre so heavy now and its just crazy so its almost like a performance argument more than like i actually am pro ads and i have a contrarian viewpoint i agree with you if you do ads right its serving you stuff you would be interested in anyway i dont mind that that actually is kind of a good thing so plus i think its rational to wanna support the people that are doing this work through seeing their ads but that said i run adblock now which i didnt wanna do but i was convinced by all these articles like 30 40 megabytes of stuff just to serve you ads yeah it feels like ads now are like the experts exchange of whenever you start a stock overflow its a little bit its overwhelming oh theres so many companies in ad tech that its embarrassing like you can do that have you seen those logo charts of like just the whole page its like you cant even see them theyre so small theres so many companies in the space but since you brought it up i do wanna point out that very very few discourse sites actually run using an ad supported model its not effective like its too diluted its too weird it doesnt pay well and like users hate it so its a combination of like users hate it it doesnt actually work that well in practice like in theory yes i agree with you if you had clean fast ads that were exactly the stuff you would be interested in awesome were so far from that though right like and google does an okay job they do retargeting and stuff like that but in the real world discourse sites rarely can make ads work it just doesnt work for so many reasons but you know what does work is subscriptions patreon affiliate codes for like amazon of like just oh heres a cool yo yo click and then you click and go to amazon they get a small percentage of that which is fair i think i mean because you saw the yo yo on that site and you clicked through and you bought it right thats fair for them to get 5 of that or 2 of that whatever it is those things definitely work in fact a site that i used to participate on a lot i helped the owner one of the things i got them to switch to discourse i basically paid them to switch to discourse because i was like look you guys got to switch i cant come here anymore on this terrible software but i was like look and on top of that like youre serving people ads that they hate like you should just go full on patreon because he had a little bit of patreon go full on patreon do the amazon affiliates thing for any amazon links that get posted and just do that and just triple down on that stuff and thats worked really well for them and this creator in particular so that stuff works but traditional ads i mean definitely not working at least on discourse so last question youve created the code keyboard ive programmed most of my adult life on a kinesis keyboard i have one upstairs now can you describe what a mechanical keyboard is and why is it something that makes you happy well you know this is another fetish item really like its not required you can do programming on any kind of keyboard even like an onscreen keyboard oh god thats terrifying but you could i mean if you look back at the early days of computing there were chiclet keyboards which are awful but whats a chiclet keyboard oh god ok well its just like thin rubber membranes oh the rubber ones oh no super bad right so its a fetish item all that really says is look i care really about keyboards because the keyboard is the primary method of communication with the computer so its just like having a nice mic for this podcast you want a nice keyboard right because it has a very tactile feel i can tell exactly when i press the key i get that little click so oh and it feels good and its also kind of a fetish item its like wow i care enough about programming that i care about the tool the primary tool that i use to communicate with the computer make sure its as good as it feels good to use for me and i can be very productive with it so to be honest its a little bit of a fetish item but a good one it indicates that youre serious it indicates youre interested it indicates that you care about the fundamentals because you know what makes you a good programmer being able to type really fast right this is true right so a core skill is just being able to type fast enough to get your ideas out of your head into the code base so just practicing your typing can make you a better programmer it is also something that makes you well makes you enjoy typing correct the actual act something about the process like i play piano its tactile theres a tactile feel that ultimately feeds the passion makes you happy right no totally thats it i mean and its funny because artisanal keyboards have exploded like massdrop has gone ballistic with this stuff theres probably like 500 keyboard projects on massdrop alone and theres some other guy i follow on twitter i used to write for the site the tech report way back in the day and hes like every week hes just posting what i call keyboard porn of just cool keyboards like oh my god those look really cool right its like how many keyboards does this guy have right its kind of like me with yo yos how many yo yos do you have how many do you need well technically one but i like a lot i dont know why so same thing with keyboards so yeah theyre awesome like i highly recommend anybody that doesnt have a mechanical to research it look into it and see what you like and its ultimately a fetish item but i think these sort of items these religious artifacts that we have are part of what make us human like that parts important right its kind of what makes life worth living yeah its not necessary in the strictest sense but aint nothing necessary if you think about it right like so yeah why not so sure jeff thank you so much for talking today yeah youre welcome thanks for having me i mean theyve been running for a long time its still an extremely rich source of information so whats broken about that system and how are you trying to fix it i think theres a lot of power in connecting people that love the same stuff around that specific topic meaning facebooks idea of connection is just any human thats related to another human right like through friendship or any other reason facebooks idea of the world is sort of the status update right like a friend of yours did something ate at a restaurant right whereas discussion forums were traditionally around the interest graph like i love electric cars specifically i love tesla right like i love the way they approach the problem i love the style of the founder i just love the design ethic and theres a lot to like about tesla i dont know if you saw the oatmeal he did a whole love comic to tesla and it was actually kind of cool because i learned some stuff he was talking about how great tesla cars were specifically like how they were built differently and he went into a lot of great detail that was really interesting and to me that oatmeal post if you read it is the genesis of pretty much all interest communities i just really love this stuff so like for me for example theres yo yos right like im into the yo yo communities and these interest communities are just really fascinating to me and i feel more connected to the yo yo communities than i do to friends that i dont see that often right like to me the powerful thing is the interest graph and facebook kind of dabbles in the interest graph i mean they have groups you can sign up for groups and stuff but its really about the relationship graph like this is my coworker this is my relative this is my friend but not so much about the interest so i think thats the linchpin of which forums and communities are built on that i personally love like i said leadership is about passion right and being passionate about stuff is a really valid way to look at the world and i think its a way a lot of stuff in the world gets done like i once had someone describe me as hes like jeff youre a guy who you just get super passionate about a few things at a time and you just go super deep in those things and i was like oh thats kind of right thats kind of what i do i get into something and just be super into that for a couple of years or whatever and just learn all i can about it and go super deep in it and thats how i enjoy experiencing the world right like not being shallow on a bunch of things but being really deep on a few things that im interested in so forums kind of unlock that right and you dont want a world where everything belongs to facebook at least i dont i want a world where communities can kind of own themselves set their own norms set their own rules control the experience because community is also about ownership right like if youre meeting at the barnes and noble every thursday and barnes and noble says get out of here you guys dont buy enough books well you know youre kind of hosed right barnes and noble owns you right like you cant but if you have your own meeting space you know your own clubhouse you can set your own rules decide what you want to talk about there and just really generate a lot better information than you could like hanging out at barnes and noble every thursday at 3 pm right so thats kind of the vision of discourse is a place where its fully open source you can take the software you can install it anywhere and you know you and a group of people can go deep on whatever it is that youre into and this works for startups right startups are a group of people who go super deep on a specific problem right and they want to talk to the community its like well install discourse right thats what we do at discourse thats what i did at stack overflow i spent a lot of time on meta stack overflow which is our internal well public community feedback site and just experiencing what the users were experiencing right because theyre the ones doing all the work in the system and they had a lot of interesting feedback and theres that 90 10 rule of like 90 of the feedback you get is not really actionable for a variety of reasons it might be bad feedback it might be crazy feedback it might be feedback you just cant act on right now but theres 10 of it thats like gold its like literally gold and diamonds where its like feedback of really good improvements to your core product that are not super hard to get to and actually make a lot of sense and my favorite is about 5 of those stuff i didnt even see coming its like oh my god i never even thought of that but thats a brilliant idea right and i can point to so many features of stack overflow that we derive from meta stack overflow feedback and meta discourse right same exact principle of discourse you know were getting ideas from the community i was like oh my god i never thought of that but thats fantastic right like i love that relationship with the community from having built these communities what have you learned about whats the process of getting a critical mass of members in a community is it luck skill timing persistence what is is it the tools like discourse that empower that community whats the key aspect of starting for one guy or gal and then building it to two and then 10 and a hundred and a thousand and so on i think when youre starting with an n of one i mean i think its persistence and also you have to be interesting like somebody i really admire once said something that i always liked about blogging hes like heres how you blog you have to have something interesting to say and have an interesting way of saying it right and then do that for like 10 years so thats the genesis is like you have to have sort of something interesting to say thats not exactly what everybody else is saying and an interesting way of saying it which is another way of saying kind of entertaining way of saying it and then as far as growing it its like ritual you know like you have to like say youre starting a blog you have to say look im gonna blog every week three times a week and you have to stick to that schedule right because until you do that for like several years youre never gonna get anywhere like it just takes years to get to where you need to get to and part of that is having the discipline to stick with the schedule and it helps again if its something youre passionate about this wont feel like work youre like i love this i could talk about this all day every day right you just have to do it in a way thats interesting to other people and then as youre growing the community that pattern of participation within the community of like generating these artifacts and inviting other people to help you like collaborate on these artifacts like even in the case of blogging like i felt in the early days of my blog which i started in 2004 which is really the genesis of stack overflow if you look at all my blog it leads up to stack overflow which was i have all this energy in my blog but i dont like 40000 people were subscribing to me and i was like i wanna do something and then i met joel and said hey joel i wanna do something take this ball of energy from my blog and do something and all the people reading my blog saw that its like oh cool youre involving us youre saying look youre part of this community lets build this thing together like they pick the name like we voted on the name for stack overflow on my blog like we came up and naming is super hard first of all the hardest problem in computer science is coming up with a good name for stuff right but you can go back to my blog theres the poll where we voted and stack overflow became the name of the site and all the early beta users of stack overflow were audience of my blog plus joels blog right so we started from like if you look at the genesis okay i was just a programmer who said hey i love programming but i have no outlet to talk about it so im just gonna blog about it because i dont have enough people to work to talk to about it because at the time i worked a place where you know programming wasnt the core output of the company it was a pharmaceutical company and i just love this stuff you know to an absurd degree so i was like ill just blog about it and then ill find an audience and eventually found an audience eventually found joel and eventually built stack overflow from that one core of activity right but it was that repetition of feeding back in feedback from my blog comments feedback from joel feedback from the early stack overflow community when people see that youre doing that they will follow along with you right theyll say cool youre here in good faith youre actually you know not listening to everything because thats impossible thats impossible but youre actually you know waiting our feedback and what youre doing and why wouldnt i because who does all the work on stack overflow me joel no its the other programmers that are doing all the work so you gotta have some respect for that and then you know discipline around look you know were trying to do a very specific thing here on stack overflow were not trying to solve all the worlds problems were trying to solve this very specific q and a problem in a very specific way not cause were jerks about it but because these strict set of rules help us get really good results right and programmers thats an easy sell for the most part because programmers are used to dealing with ridiculous systems of rules like constantly thats basically their job so theyre very oh yeah super strict system of rules that lets me get what i want thats programming right thats what stack overflow is so so youre making it sound easy but in 2004 lets go back there in 2004 you started the blog coding horror was it called that at the very beginning it was one of the smart things i did its from a book by steve mcconnell code complete which is one of my favorite programming books still probably my number one programming book for anyone to read so one of the smart things i did back then i dont always do smart things when i start stuff i contacted steve and said hey i really like this it was a sidebar illustration indicating danger in code right coding horror was like watch out and i love that illustration because it spoke to me because i saw that illustration go oh my god thats me like im always my own worst enemy like thats the key insight in programming is every time you write something think how am i gonna screw myself because you will constantly right so that icon was like oh yeah i need to constantly hold that mirror up and look and say look youre very fallible youre gonna screw this up like how can you build this in such a way that youre not gonna screw it up later like how can you get that discipline around making sure at every step im thinking through all the things that i could do wrong or that other people could do wrong because that is actually how you get to be a better programmer a lot of times right so that sidebar illustration i loved it so much and i wrote steve before i started my blog and said hey can i have permission to use this because i just really like this illustration and steve was kind enough to give me permission to do that and just continues to give me permission so yeah really thats awesome but in 2004 you started this blog you know you look at stephen king his book on writing or stephen pressfield war of art book i mean it seems like writers suffer i mean its a hard process of writing right theres gonna be suffering i mean i wont kid you well the work is suffering right like doing the work like even when youre every week youre like okay that blog post wasnt very good or people didnt like it or people said disparaging things about it you have to like have the attitude like you know no matter what happens i wanna do this for me right its not about you its about me i mean in the end it is about everyone because this is how good work gets out into the world but you have to be pretty strict about saying like you know im selfish in the sense that i have to do this for me you know you mentioned stephen king like his book on writing but like one of the things i do for example when writing is like i read it out loud one of the best pieces of advice for writing anything is read it out loud like multiple times and make it sound like youre talking because that is the goal of good writing it should sound like you said it with slightly better phrasing because you have more time to think about what youre saying but like it should sound natural when you say it and i think thats probably the single best writing advice i can give anyone just read it over and over out loud make sure it sounds like something you would normally say and it sounds good and whats your process of writing see theres usually a pretty good idea behind the blog post so ideas right so i think you gotta have the concept that theres so many interesting things in the world like i mean my god the world is amazing right like you can never write about everything thats going on because its so incredible but if you cant come up with like lets say one interesting thing per day to talk about then youre not trying hard enough because the world is full of just super interesting stuff and one great way to like mine stuff is go back to old books cause they bring up old stuff thats still super relevant and i did that a lot cause i was like reading classic programming books and a lot of the early blog posts were like oh i was reading this programming book and they brought this really cool concept and i wanna talk about it some more and you get the i mean youre not claiming credit for the idea but it gives you something interesting to talk about thats kind of evergreen right like you dont have to go what should i talk about so well just go dig up some old classic programming books and find something that oh wow thats interesting or how does that apply today or what about x and y or compare these two concepts so pull a couple of sentences from that book and then sort of play off of it almost agree or disagree so in 2007 you wrote that you were offered a significant amount of money to sell the blog you chose not to what were all the elements you were thinking about cause id like to take you back it seems like theres a lot of nonlinear decisions you made through life so what was that decision like right so one of the things i love is the choose your own adventure books which i loved as a kid and i feel like theyre early programmer books cause theyre all about if then statements right if this then this and theyre also very very unforgiving like theres all these sites that map the classic choose your own adventure books and how many outcomes are bad a lot of bad outcomes so part of the game is like oh i got a bad outcome go back one step go back one further step its like how did i get here right like its a sequence of decisions and this is true of life right like every decision is a sequence right individually any individual decision is not necessarily right or wrong but they lead you down a path right so i do think theres some truth to that so this particular decision the blog had gotten fairly popular theres a lot of rss readers that i had discovered and this guy contacted me out of the blue from this like bug tracking company hes like oh i really wanna buy your blog for like i think it was around it was 100000 it might have been like 80000 but it was a lot right like and thats you know at the time like i would have a years worth of salary all at once so i didnt really think about like well you know and i remember talking to people at the time i was like wow thats a lot of money but then im like i really like my blog right like do i wanna sell my blog cause it wouldnt really belong to me anymore at that point and one of the guidelines that i like to i dont like to give advice to people a lot but one of the pieces of advice i do give cause i do think its really true and its generally helpful is whenever youre looking at a set of decisions like oh gosh should i do a b or c you gotta pick the thing thats a little scarier in that list because not you know not like jump off a cliff scary but the thing that makes you nervous cause if you pick the safe choice its usually youre not really pushing youre not pushing yourself youre not choosing the thing thats gonna help you grow so for me the scarier choice was to say no i was like well no lets just see where this is going right because then i own it i mean it belongs to me its my thing and i can just take it and tell some other logical conclusion right because imagine how different the world would have been had i said yes and sold the blog its like there probably wouldnt be stack overflow you know a lot of other stuff would have changed so for that particular decision i think it was that same rule like what scares me a little bit more do the thing that scares you yeah so speaking of which startups i think theres a specific some more general questions that a lot of people would be interested in youve started stack overflow you started this course so whats the it was one two three guys whatever it is in the beginning what was that process like do you start talking about it do you start programming do you start like wheres the birth and the catalyst that actually well i can talk about it in the context of both stack overflow and discourse so i think the key thing initially is there is a problem something theres some state of the world thats unsatisfactory to the point that like youre upset about it right like in that case it was experts exchange i mean joels original idea because i approached joel as like look joel i have all this energy behind my blog i want to do something i want to build something but i dont know what it is because im honestly not a good idea person im really not im like the execution guy im really good at execution but im not good at like blue skying ideas not my forte which is another reason why i like the community feedback because they blue sky all day long for you right so when i can just go in and cherry pick a blue sky idea from community even if i have to spend three hours reading to get one good idea its worth it man but anyway so the idea from joel was hey experts exchange its got great data but the experience is hideous right its trying to trick you it feels like used car salesman its just bad so i was like oh thats awesome it feeds into community it feeds into like you know we can make creative comments so i think the core is to have a really good idea that you feel very strongly about in the beginning that like theres a wrong in the world an injustice that we will write through the process of building this thing for discourse it was like look theres no good software for communities to just hang out and like do stuff right like whether its problem solving startup whatever forums are such a great building block of online community and theyre hideous they were so bad right it was embarrassing like i literally was embarrassed to be associated with this software right i was like we have to have software that you can be proud of its like this is competitive with reddit this is competitive with twitter this is competitive with facebook right i would be proud to have the software on my site so that was the genesis of discourse was feeling very strongly about there needs to be a good solution for communities so thats step one genesis of an idea you feel super strongly about right and then people galvanize around the idea like joel was already super excited about the idea i was excited about the idea so with the forum software i was posting on twitter i had researched as part of my research i start researching the problem right and i found a game called forum wars which was a parody of forum its still very very funny of forum behavior circa i would say 2003 its aged some right like the behaviors a little different in there of twitter but it was awesome it was very funny and it was like a game it was like an rpg and it had a forum attached to it so it was like a game about forums with a forum attached i was like this is awesome right this is so cool and the founder of that company or that project it wasnt really a company contacted me this guy robin ward from toronto he said hey i saw youve been talking about forums and i really love that problem space he was like id still love to build really good forum software because i dont think anything out theres any good and i was like awesome at that point i was like were starting a company because i couldnt have whooshed for a better person to walk through the door and say im excited about this too same thing with joel right i mean joel is a legend in the industry right so when he walked through and said im excited about this problem i was like me too man we can do this right so that to me is the most important step its like having an idea youre super excited about and another person a cofounder right because again you get that dual leadership right am i making a bad decision sometimes its nice to have checks of like is this a good idea i dont know right so those are the crucial seeds but then starting to build stuff whether its you programming or somebody elses there is prototyping so theres tons of research theres tons of research like whats out there that failed because a lot of people look at the successes oh look at how successful x is everybody looks at the successes those are boring show me the failures because that is whats interesting thats where people were experimenting thats where people were pushing and they failed but they probably failed for reasons that werent directly about the quality of their idea right so look at all the failures dont just look what everybody looks at which is like oh gosh look at all these successful people look at the failures look at the things that didnt work research the entire field and so thats the research that i was doing that led me to robin right was that and then when we for example when we did stack overflow were like okay well i really like elements of voting and dig and read it i like the wikipedia everythings up to date nothing is like an old tombstone that has horrible out of date information we know that works wikipedia is an amazing resource blogging the idea of ownership is so powerful right like oh i joe wrote this and look how good joes answer is right all these concepts were rolling together researching all the things that were out there that were working and why they were working and trying to fold them into again that frankensteins monster of what stack overflow is and by the way that wasnt a free decision because theres still a ton of tension in the stack overflow system theres reasons people complain about stack overflow because its so strict right why is it so strict why are you guys always closing my questions its because theres so much tension that we built into the system around trying to get good good results out of the system and its not a free that stuff doesnt come for free right its not like we we all have perfect answers and nobody will have to get their feelings heard or nobody will have to get downvoted it doesnt work that way right so this is an interesting point and a small tangent you write about anxiety so ive posted a lot of questions and written answers on stack overflow on the question side you usually go to something very specific to something im working on and this is something you talk about that really the goal of stack overflow isnt about is to write a question thats not about you its about the question that will help the community in the future right but thats a tough sell right because people are like well i dont really care about the community what i care about is my problem and thats fair right its sort of that again that tension that balancing act of we wanna help you but we also wanna help everybody that comes behind you the long line of people are gonna come up and say oh i kinda have that problem too right and if nobodys ever gonna come up and say i have this problem too then that question shouldnt exist on stack overflow because the question is too specific and even thats tension right how do you judge that how do you know that nobodys ever gonna have this particular question again so theres a lot of tension in the system do you think that anxiety of asking the question the anxiety of answering that tension is inherent to programmers is inherent to this kind of process or can it be improved can it be happy land where that tension is not quite so harsh i dont think stack overflow can totally change the way it works one thing they are working on finally is the ask page had not changed since 2011 im still kind of bitter about this because i feel like you have a qa system and what are the core pages in a qa system well first of all the question all the answers and also the ask page particularly when youre a new user or someone trying to ask a question thats the point at which you need the most help and we just didnt adapt with the times but the good news is theyre working on this from what i understand and its gonna be a more wizard based format and you could envision a world where as part of this wizard based program when youre asking questions okay come up with a good title what are good words to put in the title one word thats not good to put in the title is problem for example i have a problem oh you have a problem okay a problem thats great you need specifics so its trying to help you make a good question title for example that step will be broken out all that stuff but one of those steps in that wizard of asking could say hey im a little nervous ive never done this before can you put me in a queue for special mentoring you could opt in to a special mentor i think that would be fantastic i dont have any objection to that at all in terms of being an opt in system because there are people that are like i just wanna help them i wanna help a person no matter what i wanna go above and beyond i wanna spend hours with this person it depends what their goals are its a great idea who am i to judge so thats fine its not precluded from happening but theres a certain big city ethos that we started with like look were in new york city you dont come to new york city and expect them to be oh welcome to the city joe hows it going come on in let me show you around thats not how new york city works again new york city has a reputation for being rude which i actually dont think it is having been there fairly recently its not rude its just like going about their business like look i have things to do im busy im a busy professional as are you and since youre a busy professional certainly when you ask a question youre gonna ask the best possible question because youre a busy professional and you would not accept anything less than a very well written question with a lot of detail about why youre doing it what youre doing what you researched what you found because youre a professional like me and this rubs people sometimes the wrong way and i dont think its wrong to say look i dont want that experience i want just a more chill place for beginners and i still think stack overflow is not was never designed for beginners right theres this misconception that even joel says sometimes oh yeah stack overflow for beginners and i think if youre a prodigy it can be right but for the most part not but thats not really representative right like i think as a beginner you want a totally different set of tools you want like live screen sharing live chat you want access to resources you want a playground like a playground you can experiment in and like test and all this stuff that we just dont give people because that was never really the audience that we were designing stack overflow for that doesnt mean its wrong and i think it would be awesome if there was a site like that on the internet or if stack overflow said hey you know were gonna start doing this thats fine too you know im not there im not making those decisions but i do think the pressure the tension that you described is there for people to be look im a little nervous because i know i gotta do my best work right the other one is something you talk about which is also really interesting to me is duplicate questions or its a really difficult problem that you highlight its super hard like you could take one little topic and you could probably write 10 20 30 ways of asking about that topic and there will be all different i dont know if there should be one page that answers all of it is there a way that stack overflow can help disambiguate like separate these duplicate questions or connect them together or is it a totally hopeless difficult impossible task i think its a very very hard computer science problem and partly because people are very good at using completely different words it always amazed me on stack overflow youd have two questions that were functionally identical and one question had like zero words in common with the other question like oh my god from a computer science perspective how do you even begin to solve that and it happens all the time people are super good at this right accidentally at asking the same thing in like 10 20 different ways and the other complexity is we want some of those duplicates to exist because if theres five versions with different words have those five versions point to the one centralized answer right its like okay this is a duplicate no worries heres the answer that you wanted over here on the prime example that we want to have rather than having 10 copies of the question and the answer because if you have 10 copies of the question and answer this also devalues the reputation system which programmers hate as i previously mentioned youre getting reputation for an answer that somebody else already gave its like well its an answer but somebody else already gave that answer so why are you getting reputation for the same answer as the other guy who gave it four years ago people get offended by that right so the reputation system itself adds tension to the system in that the people who have a lot of reputation become very incentivized to enforce the reputation system and for the most part thats good i know it sounds weird but for most parts like look strict systems i think to use stack overflow you have to have the idea that ok strict systems ultimately work better and i do think in programming youre familiar with loose typing versus strict typing right the idea that you can declare a variable not declare a variable rather just start using a variable and ok i see its implicitly an integer bam awesome duck equals 5 well duck is now an integer of 5 right and youre like cool awesome simpler right why would i want to worry about typing and for a long time in the ruby community theyre like yeah this is awesome you just do a bunch of unit testing which is testing your programs validity after the fact to catch any bugs that strict typing of variables would have caught and now you have this thing called typescript for microsoft from the guy who built c sharp anders whos one of the greatest minds in software development right like in terms of language design and says no no no we want to bolt on a strict type system to javascript because it makes things better and now everybodys like oh my god we deployed typescript and found 50 latent bugs that we didnt know about right like this is super common so i think there is a truth in programming that strictness its not the goal were not saying be super strict because strictness is correct no its no no strictness produces better results thats what im saying right so strict typing of variables i would say you almost universally have consensus now is basically correct should be that way in every language right duck equals five should generate an error because no you didnt declare you didnt tell me that duck was an integer right thats a bug right or maybe you mistyped you typed deck instead of duck right you never know this happens all the time right so with that in mind i will say that the strictness of the system is correct now that doesnt mean cruel that doesnt mean mean that doesnt mean angry it just means strict ok so i think where theres misunderstanding is people get cranky right like another question you asked is like why are programmers kind of mean sometimes well who do programmers work with all day long so i have a theory that if youre at a job and you work with assholes all day long what do you eventually become an asshole an asshole and what is the computer except the worlds biggest asshole because the computer has no time for your bullshit the computer the minute you make a mistake everything is crashing down right one semicolon has crashed space missions right so thats normal so you begin to internalize that you begin to think oh my coworker the computer is super strict and kind of a jerk about everything so thats kind of how im going to be because i work with this computer and i have to exceed to its terms on everything so therefore you start to absorb that you start to think oh well being really strict arbitrarily is really good an error of error code 56249 is a completely good error message because thats what the computer gave me right so you kind of forget to be a person at some level and you know how they say great detectives internalize criminals and kind of are criminals themselves like this trope of the master detective is good because he can think like the criminal well i do think thats true of programmers really good programmers think like the computer because thats their job but if you internalize it too much you become the computer you kind of become a jerk to everybody because thats what youve internalized youre almost not a jerk but you have no patience for a lack of strictness as you said its not out of a sense of meanness its accidental but i do believe its an occupational hazard of being a programmer is you start to behave like the computer youre very unforgiving youre very terse youre very oh wrong incorrect move on its like well can you help me what could i do to fix no wrong next question like thats normal for the computer just fail next i dont know if you remember in saturday night live in the 90s they had this character who was an it guy the move guy move move was that jimmy fallon no no who played him ok yeah i remember move right he had no patience for it might have been mad tv actually wasnt it mad tv might have been but anyway thats always been the perception you start to behave like the computer its like oh youre wrong out of the way you know youve written so many blog posts about programming about programs programming programmers what do you think makes a good lets start with what makes a good solo programmer well i dont think you should be a solo programmer i think to be a good solo programmer its kind of like what i talked about well not on mike but one of the things john carmack one of the best points he makes in the book masters of doom which is a fantastic book and anybody listening to this who hasnt read it please read it its such a great book is that at the time they were working on stuff like wolfenstein and doom they didnt have the resources that we have today they didnt have stack overflow they didnt have wikipedia they didnt have discourse forums they didnt have places to go to get people to help them they had to work on their own and thats why it took a genius like carmack to do this stuff because you had to be a genius to invent from first principles a lot of the stuff he was like the hacks he was coming up with were genius genius level stuff but you dont need to be a genius anymore and that means not working by yourself you have to be good at researching stuff online you have to be good at asking questions really good questions that are really well researched which implies oh i went out and researched for three hours before i wrote these questions thats what you should be doing because thats whats going to make you good to me this is the big difference between programming in the 80s versus programming today is you kind of had to be by yourself back then where would you go for answers i remember in the early days when i was learning visual basic for windows i would call the microsoft helpline on the phone when i had programming because i was like i dont know what to do so i would go and call and they had these huge phone banks and im like can you imagine how alien that is now who would do that thats crazy so there was just nowhere else to go when you got stuck i had the books that came with it i read those studied those religiously i just saw a post from steve sanofsky that said the c version 7 came with 10000 pages of written material because where else were you going to figure that stuff out go to the library i mean you didnt have wikipedia you didnt have reddit you didnt have anywhere to go to answer these questions so youve talked about through the years basically not having an ego and not thinking that youre the best programmer in the world so always kind of just looking to improve to become a better programmer than you were yesterday so how have you changed as a programmer and as a thinker designer around programming over the past what is it 15 years really of being a public figure i would say the big insight that i had is eventually as a programmer you have to stop writing code to be effective which is kind of disturbing because you really love it but you realize being effective at programming at programming in the general sense doesnt mean writing code and a lot of times you can be much more successful by not writing code and writing code in terms of just solving the problems you have essentially hiring people that are really good and setting them free and giving them basic direction on strategy and stuff because a lot of the problems you encounter arent necessarily solved through really gnarly code theyre solved by conceptual solutions which can then be turned into code but are you even solving the right problem so i would say for me the main insight i have is to succeed as a programmer you eventually kind of stop writing code thats going to sound discouraging probably to people hearing but i dont mean it that way what i mean is that youre coding at a higher level language eventually like ok so were coding in assembly language thats the beginning right youre hardcoded to the architecture then you have stuff like c where its like wow we can abstract across the architecture we can write code i can then compile that code for arm or whatever x86 or whatever else is out there and then even higher level than that youre looking at python ruby interpreted languages and then to me as a programmer im like ok i want to go even higher i want to go higher than that how do i abstract higher than the language its like well you abstract in spoken language and written language right youre sort of inspiring people to get things done giving them guidance like what if we did this what if we did this youre writing in the highest level language that there is which is for me english whatever your spoken language is so its all about being effective right and i think patrick mckenzie patio11 on hacker news and works at stripe has a great post about this of how calling yourself a programmer is a career limiting move at some level once you get far enough from your career and i really believe that and again i apologize this is sound discouraging i dont mean it to be but hes so right because all the stuff that goes on around the code like the people thats another thing if you look at my early blog entries is about wow programming is about people more than its about code which doesnt really make sense but its about can these people even get along together can they understand each other can you even explain to me what it is youre working on are you solving the right problem peopleware another classic programming book which again up there with code complete please read peopleware its that software is people people are the software first and foremost so a lot of the skills that i was working on early in the blog were about figuring out the people parts of programming which were the harder parts the hard part of programming once you get a certain skill level in programming you can pretty much solve any reasonable problem thats put in front of you youre not writing algorithms from scratch that just doesnt happen so any sort of reasonable problem put in front of you youre going to be able to solve but what you cant solve is our manager is a total jerk you cannot solve that with code that is not a code solvable problem and yet that will cripple you way more than oh we had to use this stupid framework i dont like or sam keeps writing bad code that i hate or dave is off there in the wilderness writing god knows what these are not your problems your problem is your manager or a co worker is so toxic to everybody else in your team that nobody can get anything done because everybodys so stressed out and freaked out these are the problems that you have to attack absolutely and so as you go to these higher level abstractions as youve developed as a programmer to higher and higher level abstractions and go into natural language youre also the guy who preached building it diving in and doing it and learn by doing yes do you worry that as you get to higher and higher level abstractions you lose track of the lower level of just building do you worry about that even not maybe now but 10 years from now 20 years from now well no i mean there is always that paranoia around oh gosh i dont feel its valuable since im not writing code but for me when we started the discourse project it was ruby which i didnt really know ruby i mean as you pointed out and this is another valuable observation in stack overflow you can be super proficient in for example c sharp which i was working in thats what we built stack overflow in and still is written in and then switch to ruby and youre a newbie again but you have the framework i know what a for loop is i know what recursion is i know what a stack trace is i have all the fundamental concepts to be a programmer i just dont know ruby so im still on a higher level im not like a beginner beginner like youre saying im just like i need to apply my programming concepts i already know to ruby well so theres a question thats really interesting so looking at ruby how do you go about learning enough that your intuition can be applied carried over thats what i was trying to get to its like what i realized particularly when i started with just me and robin i realized if i bother robin i am now costing us productivity every time i go to robin rather than building our first alpha version of discourse hes now answering my stupid questions about ruby is that a good use of his time is that a good use of my time and the answer to both of those was resoundingly no we were getting to an alpha and it was pretty much just ok well hire more programmers we eventually hired neil and then eventually sam who came in as a cofounder actually it was sam first then neil later but the answer to the problem is just hire other competent programmers now i shall pull myself up by my bootstraps and learn ruby but at some point writing code becomes a liability to you in terms of getting things done theres so many other things that go on in the project like building the prototype you mentioned well how do you if youre not writing code how does everybody keep focus on what are we building well first basic mockups and research what do we even want to build theres a little bit of that that goes on but then very quickly you get to the prototype stage like build a prototype lets iterate on the prototype really really rapidly and thats what we do with discourse and thats what we demoed to get our seed funding for discourse was the alpha version of discourse that we had running and ready to go and it was very it was bad i mean it was ill just tell you it was bad we have screenshots of it im just embarrassed to look at it now but it was the prototype we were figuring out whats working whats not working because theres such a broad gap between the way you think things will work in your mind or even on paper and the way they work once you sit and live in the software like actually spend time living and breathing in software so different so my philosophy is get to a prototype and then what youre really optimizing for is speed of iteration like how you can turn the crank how quickly can we iterate thats the absolutely critical metric of any software project and i had a tweet recently that people liked and i totally this is so fundamental to what i do is like if you want to measure the core competency of any software tech company its the speed at which somebody can say hey we really need this word in the product change this word right because it will be more clear to the user like instead of respond its reply or something but theres some from the conception of that idea to how quickly that single word can be changed in your software and rolled out to users that is your life cycle thats your health your heartbeat if your heartbeat is like super slow youre basically dead no seriously like if it takes two weeks or even a month to get that single word changed everybodys like oh my god this is a great idea that word is so much clearer im talking about like a super like everybodys on board for this change its not like lets just change a word because were bored its like this is an awesome change and then it takes months to roll out its like well youre dead you cant iterate you cant how are you going to do anything right so anyway about the heartbeat its like get the prototype and then iterate on it thats what i view as the central tenet of modern software development thats fascinating that you put it that way so i work and i build autonomous vehicles and when you look at what maybe compare tesla to most other automakers the heart beat for tesla is literally days now in terms of they can over the air deploy software updates to all their vehicles which is markedly different than every other automaker which takes years to update a piece of software and thats reflected in everything thats the final product thats reflected in really how slowly they adapt to the times and to be clear im not saying being a hummingbird is the goal either', 'the following is a conversation with eric schmidt he was the ceo of google for 10 years and a chairman for six more guiding the company through an incredible period of growth and a series of world changing innovations he is one of the most impactful leaders in the era of the internet and the powerful voice for the promise of technology in our society it was truly an honor to speak with him as part of the mit course on artificial general intelligence and the artificial intelligence podcast and now heres my conversation with eric schmidt what was the first moment when you fell in love with technology i grew up in the 1960s as a boy where every boy wanted to be an astronaut and part of the space program so like everyone else of my age we would go out to the cow pasture behind my house which was literally a cow pasture and we would shoot model rockets off and that i think is the beginning and of course generationally today it would be video games and all the amazing things that you can do online with computers theres a transformative inspiring aspect of science and math that maybe rockets would bring would instill in individuals youve mentioned yesterday that eighth grade math is where the journey through mathematical universe diverges from many people its this fork in the roadway theres a professor of math at berkeley edward frankel he im not sure if youre familiar with him i am he has written this amazing book i recommend to everybody called love and math two of my favorite words he says that if painting was taught like math then the students would be asked to paint a fence which is his analogy of essentially how math is taught and so you never get a chance to discover the beauty of the art of painting or the beauty of the art of math so how when and where did you discover that beauty i think what happens with people like myself is that your math enabled pretty early and all of a sudden you discover that you can use that to discover new insights the great scientists will all tell a story the men and women who are fantastic today that somewhere when they were in high school or in college they discovered that they could discover something themselves and that sense of building something of having an impact that you own drives knowledge acquisition and learning in my case it was programming and the notion that i could build things that had not existed that i had built that it had my name on it and this was before open source but you could think of it as open source contributions so today if i were a 16 or 17 year old boy im sure that i would aspire as a computer scientist to make a contribution like the open source heroes of the world today that would be what would be driving me and id be trying and learning and making mistakes and so forth in the ways that it works the repository that github represents and that open source libraries represent is an enormous bank of knowledge of all of the people who are doing that and one of the lessons that i learned at google was that the world is a very big place and theres an awful lot of smart people and an awful lot of them are underutilized so heres an opportunity for example building parts of programs building new ideas to contribute to the greater of society so in that moment in the 70s the inspiring moment where there was nothing and then you created something through programming that magical moment so in 1975 i think youve created a program called lex which i especially like because my name is lex so thank you thank you for creating a brand that established a reputation thats long lasting reliable and has a big impact on the world and still used today so thank you for that but more seriously in that time in the 70s as an engineer personal computers were being born do you think youd be able to predict the 80s 90s and the aughts of where computers would go im sure i could not and would not have gotten it right i was the beneficiary of the great work of many many people who saw it clearer than i did with lex i worked with a fellow named michael lesk who was my supervisor and he essentially helped me architect and deliver a system thats still in use today after that i worked at xerox palo alto research center where the alto was invented and the alto is the predecessor of the modern personal computer or macintosh and so forth and the altos were very rare and i had to drive an hour from berkeley to go use them but i made a point of skipping classes and doing whatever it took to have access to this extraordinary achievement i knew that they were consequential what i did not understand was scaling i did not understand what would happen when you had 100 million as opposed to 100 and so the since then and i have learned the benefit of scale i always look for things which are going to scale to platforms right so mobile phones android all those things there are the world is in numerous there are many many people in the world people really have needs they really will use these platforms and you can build big businesses on top of them so its interesting so when you see a piece of technology now you think what will this technology look like when its in the hands of a billion people thats right so an example would be that the market is so competitive now that if you cant figure out a way for something to have a million users or a billion users it probably is not going to be successful because something else will become the general platform and your idea will become a lost idea or a specialized service with relatively few users so its a path to generality its a path to general platform use its a path to broad applicability now there are plenty of good businesses that are tiny so luxury goods for example but if you want to have an impact at scale you have to look for things which are of common value common pricing common distribution and solve common problems theyre problems that everyone has and by the way people have lots of problems information medicine health education and so forth work on those problems like you said youre a big fan of the middle class because theres so many of them theres so many of them by definition so any product any thing that has a huge impact and improves their lives is a great business decision and its just good for society and theres nothing wrong with starting off in the high end as long as you have a plan to get to the middle class theres nothing wrong with starting with a specialized market in order to learn and to build and to fund things so you start with a luxury market to build a general purpose market but if you define yourself as only a narrow market someone else can come along with a general purpose market that can push you to the corner can restrict the scale of operation can force you to be a lesser impact than you might be so its very important to think in terms of broad businesses and broad impact even if you start in a little corner somewhere so as you look to the 70s but also in the decades to come and you saw computers did you see them as tools or was there a little element of another entity i remember a quote saying ai began with our dream to create the gods is there a feeling when you wrote that program that you were creating another entity giving life to something i wish i could say otherwise but i simply found the technology platforms so exciting thats what i was focused on i think the majority of the people that ive worked with and there are a few exceptions steve jobs being an example really saw this as a great technological play i think relatively few of the technical people understood the scale of its impact so i used ncp which is a predecessor to tcpip it just made sense to connect things we didnt think of it in terms of the internet and then companies and then facebook and then twitter and then politics and so forth we never did that build we didnt have that vision and i think most people its a rare person who can see compounding at scale most people can see if you ask people to predict the future theyll give you an answer of six to nine months or 12 months because thats about as far as people can imagine but theres an old saying which actually was attributed to a professor at mit a long time ago that we overestimate what can be done in one year and we underestimate what can be done in a decade and theres a great deal of evidence that these core platforms at hardware and software take a decade right so think about self driving cars self driving cars were thought about in the 90s there were projects around them the first darpa grand challenge was roughly 2004 so thats roughly 15 years ago and today we have self driving cars operating in a city in arizona right its 15 years and we still have a ways to go before theyre more generally available so youve spoken about the importance you just talked about predicting into the future youve spoken about the importance of thinking five years ahead and having a plan for those five years the way to say it is that almost everybody has a one year plan almost no one has a proper five year plan and the key thing to having a five year plan is to having a model for whats going to happen under the underlying platforms so heres an example moores law as we know it the thing that powered improvements in cpus has largely halted in its traditional shrinking mechanism because the costs have just gotten so high its getting harder and harder but theres plenty of algorithmic improvements and specialized hardware improvements so you need to understand the nature of those improvements and where theyll go in order to understand how it will change the platform in the area of network connectivity what are the gains that are gonna be possible in wireless it looks like theres an enormous expansion of wireless connectivity at many different bands and that we will primarily historically ive always thought that we were primarily gonna be using fiber but now it looks like were gonna be using fiber plus very powerful high bandwidth sort of short distance connectivity to bridge the last mile thats an amazing achievement if you know that then youre gonna build your systems differently by the way those networks have different latency properties right because theyre more symmetric the algorithms feel faster for that reason and so when you think about whether its a fiber or just technologies in general so theres this barber wooden poem or quote that i really like its from the champions of the impossible rather than the slaves of the possible that evolution draws its creative force so in predicting the next five years id like to talk about the impossible and the possible well and again one of the great things about humanity is that we produce dreamers right we literally have people who have a vision and a dream they are if you will disagreeable in the sense that they disagree with the they disagree with what the sort of zeitgeist is they say there is another way they have a belief they have a vision if you look at science science is always marked by such people who went against some conventional wisdom collected the knowledge at the time and assembled it in a way that produced a powerful platform and youve been amazingly honest about in an inspiring way about things youve been wrong about predicting and youve obviously been right about a lot of things but in this kind of tension how do you balance as a company in predicting the next five years the impossible planning for the impossible so listening to those crazy dreamers letting them do letting them run away and make the impossible real make it happen and slow you know thats how programmers often think and slowing things down and saying well this is the rational this is the possible the pragmatic the dreamer versus the pragmatist so its helpful to have a model which encourages a predictable revenue stream as well as the ability to do new things so in googles case were big enough and well enough managed and so forth that we have a pretty good sense of what our revenue will be for the next year or two at least for a while and so we have enough cash generation that we can make bets and indeed google has become alphabet so the corporation is organized around these bets and these bets are in areas of fundamental importance to the world whether its artificial intelligence medical technology self driving cars connectivity through balloons on and on and on and theres more coming and more coming so one way you could express this is that the current business is successful enough that we have the luxury of making bets and another one that you could say is that we have the wisdom of being able to see that a corporate structure needs to be created to enhance the likelihood of the success of those bets so we essentially turned ourselves into a conglomerate of bets and then this underlying corporation google which is itself innovative so in order to pull this off you have to have a bunch of belief systems and one of them is that you have to have bottoms up and tops down the bottoms up we call 20 time and the idea is that people can spend 20 of the time whatever they want and the top down is that our founders in particular have a keen eye on technology and theyre reviewing things constantly so an example would be theyll hear about an idea or ill hear about something and it sounds interesting lets go visit them and then lets begin to assemble the pieces to see if thats possible and if you do this long enough you get pretty good at predicting whats likely to work so thats a beautiful balance that struck is this something that applies at all scale it seems to be that sergey again 15 years ago came up with a concept called 10 of the budget should be on things that are unrelated it was called 70 20 10 70 of our time on core business 20 on adjacent business and 10 on other and he proved mathematically of course hes a brilliant mathematician that you needed that 10 to make the sum of the growth work and it turns out he was right so getting into the world of artificial intelligence youve talked quite extensively and effectively to the impact in the near term the positive impact of artificial intelligence whether its especially machine learning in medical applications and education and just making information more accessible right in the ai community there is a kind of debate theres this shroud of uncertainty as we face this new world with artificial intelligence in it and theres some people like elon musk youve disagreed at least on the degree of emphasis he places on the existential threat of ai so ive spoken with stuart russell max tegmark who share elon musks view and yoshua bengio steven pinker who do not and so theres a lot of very smart people who are thinking about this stuff disagreeing which is really healthy of course so what do you think is the healthiest way for the ai community to and really for the general public to think about ai and the concern of the technology being mismanaged in some kind of way so the source of education for the general public has been robot killer movies right and terminator et cetera and the one thing i can assure you were not building are those kinds of solutions furthermore if they were to show up someone would notice and unplug them right so as exciting as those movies are and theyre great movies were the killer robots to start we would find a way to stop them right so im not concerned about that and much of this has to do with the timeframe of conversation so you can imagine a situation 100 years from now when the human brain is fully understood and the next generation and next generation of brilliant mit scientists have figured all this out were gonna have a large number of ethics questions right around science and thinking and robots and computers and so forth and so on so it depends on the question of the timeframe in the next five to 10 years were not facing those questions what were facing in the next five to 10 years is how do we spread this disruptive technology as broadly as possible to gain the maximum benefit of it the primary benefits should be in healthcare and in education healthcare because its obvious were all the same even though we somehow believe were not as a medical matter the fact that we have big data about our health will save lives allow us to deal with skin cancer and other cancers ophthalmological problems theres people working on psychological diseases and so forth using these techniques i can go on and on the promise of ai in medicine is extraordinary there are many many companies and startups and funds and solutions and we will all live much better for that the same argument in education can you imagine that for each generation of child and even adult you have a tutor educator thats ai based thats not a human but is properly trained that helps you get smarter helps you address your language difficulties or your math difficulties or what have you why dont we focus on those two the gains societally of making humans smarter and healthier are enormous and those translate for decades and decades and well all benefit from them there are people who are working on ai safety which is the issue that youre describing and there are conversations in the community that should there be such problems what should the rules be like google for example has announced its policies with respect to ai safety which i certainly support and i think most everybody would support and they make sense right so it helps guide the research but the killer robots are not arriving this year and theyre not even being built and on that line of thinking you said the time scale in this topic or other topics have you found it useful on the business side or the intellectual side to think beyond five 10 years to think 50 years out has it ever been useful or productive in our industry there are essentially no examples of 50 year predictions that have been correct lets review ai right ai which was largely invented here at mit and a couple of other universities in the 1956 1957 1958 the original claims were a decade or two and when i was a phd student i studied ai a bit and it entered during my looking at it a period which is known as ai winter which went on for about 30 years which is a whole generation of science scientists and a whole group of people who didnt make a lot of progress because the algorithms had not improved and the computers had not approved it took some brilliant mathematicians starting with a fellow named jeff hinton at toronto and montreal who basically invented this deep learning model which empowers us today the seminal work there was 20 years ago and in the last 10 years its become popularized so think about the timeframes for that level of discovery its very hard to predict many people think that well be flying around in the equivalent of flying cars who knows my own view if i wanna go out on a limb is to say that we know a couple of things about 50 years from now we know that therell be more people alive we know that well have to have platforms that are more sustainable because the earth is limited in the ways we all know and that the kind of platforms that are gonna get built will be consistent with the principles that ive described they will be much more empowering of individuals theyll be much more sensitive to the ecology because they have to be they just have to be i also think that humans are gonna be a great deal smarter and i think theyre gonna be a lot smarter because of the tools that ive discussed with you and of course people will live longer life extension is continuing apace a baby born today has a reasonable chance of living to 100 which is pretty exciting its well past the 21st century so we better take care of them and you mentioned an interesting statistic on some very large percentage 60 70 of people may live in cities today more than half the world lives in cities and one of the great stories of humanity in the last 20 years has been the rural to urban migration this has occurred in the united states its occurred in europe its occurring in asia and its occurring in africa when people move to cities the cities get more crowded but believe it or not their health gets better their productivity gets better their iq and educational capabilities improve so its good news that people are moving to cities but we have to make them livable and safe so you first of all you are but youve also worked with some of the greatest leaders in the history of tech what insights do you draw from the difference in leadership styles of yourself steve jobs elon musk larry page now the new ceo sandra pichai and others from the i would say calm sages to the mad geniuses one of the things that i learned as a young executive is that theres no single formula for leadership they try to teach one but thats not how it really works there are people who just understand what they need to do and they need to do it quickly those people are often entrepreneurs they just know and they move fast there are other people who are systems thinkers and planners thats more who i am somewhat more conservative more thorough in execution a little bit more risk of risk a little bit more risk averse theres also people who are sort of slightly insane in the sense that they are emphatic and charismatic and they feel it and they drive it and so forth theres no single formula to success there is one thing that unifies all of the people that you named which is very high intelligence at the end of the day the thing that characterizes all of them is that they saw the world quicker faster they processed information faster they didnt necessarily make the right decisions all the time but they were on top of it and the other thing thats interesting about all those people is they all started young so think about steve jobs starting apple roughly at 18 or 19 think about bill gates starting at roughly 20 21 think about by the time they were 30 mark zuckerberg a good example at 19 20 by the time they were 30 they had 10 years at 30 years old they had 10 years of experience of dealing with people and products and shipments and the press and business and so forth its incredible how much experience they had compared to the rest of us who were busy getting our phds yes exactly so we should celebrate these people because theyve just had more life experience right and that helps inform the judgment at the end of the day when youre at the top of these organizations all the easy questions have been dealt with right how should we design the buildings where should we put the colors on our product what should the box look like right the problems thats why its so interesting to be in these rooms the problems that they face right in terms of the way they operate the way they deal with their employees their customers their innovation are profoundly challenging each of the companies is demonstrably different culturally they are not in fact cut of the same they behave differently based on input their internal cultures are different their compensation schemes are different their values are different so theres proof that diversity works so so when faced with a tough decision in need of advice its been said that the best thing one can do is to find the best person in the world who can give that advice and find a way to be in a room with them one on one and ask so here we are and let me ask in a long winded way i wrote this down in 1998 there were many good search engines lycos excite altavista infoseek ask jeeves maybe yahoo even so google stepped in and disrupted everything they disrupted the nature of search the nature of our access to information the way we discover new knowledge so now its 2018 actually 20 years later there are many good personal ai assistants including of course the best from google so youve spoken in medical and education the impact of such an ai assistant could bring so we arrive at this question so its a personal one for me but i hope my situation represents that of many other as we said dreamers and the crazy engineers so my whole life ive dreamed of creating such an ai assistant every step ive taken has been towards that goal now im a research scientist in human centered ai here at mit so the next step for me as i sit here so facing my passion is to do what larry and sergey did in 98 this simple startup and so heres my simple question given the low odds of success the timing and luck required the countless other factors that cant be controlled or predicted which is all the things that larry and sergey faced is there some calculation some strategy to follow in this step or do you simply follow the passion just because theres no other choice i think the people who are in universities are always trying to study the extraordinarily chaotic nature of innovation and entrepreneurship my answer is that they didnt have that conversation they just did it they sensed a moment when in the case of google there was all of this data that needed to be organized and they had a better algorithm they had invented a better way so today with human centered ai which is your area of research there must be new approaches its such a big field there must be new approaches different from what we and others are doing there must be startups to fund there must be research projects to try there must be graduate students to work on new approaches here at mit there are people who are looking at learning from the standpoint of looking at child learning how do children learn starting at age one and two and the work is fantastic those approaches are different from the approach that most people are taking perhaps thats a bet that you should make or perhaps theres another one but at the end of the day the successful entrepreneurs are not as crazy as they sound they see an opportunity based on whats happened lets use uber as an example as travis sells the story he and his co founder were sitting in paris and they had this idea because they couldnt get a cab and they said we have smartphones and the rest is history so whats the equivalent of that travis eiffel tower where is a cab moment that you could as an entrepreneur take advantage of whether its in human centered ai or something else thats the next great startup and the psychology of that moment so when sergey and larry talk about and listen to a few interviews its very nonchalant well heres the very fascinating web data and heres an algorithm we have for we just kind of want to play around with that data and it seems like thats a really nice way to organize this data i should say what happened to remember is that they were graduate students at stanford and they thought this was interesting so they built a search engine and they kept it in their room and they had to get power from the room next door because they were using too much power in the room so they ran an extension cord over right and then they went and they found a house and they had google world headquarters of five people right to start the company and they raised 100000 from andy bechtolsheim who was the sun founder to do this and dave cheriton and a few others the point is their beginnings were very simple but they were based on a powerful insight that is a replicable model for any startup it has to be a powerful insight the beginnings are simple and there has to be an innovation in larry and sergeys case it was pagerank which was a brilliant idea one of the most cited papers in the world today whats the next one so youre one of if i may say richest people in the world and yet it seems that money is simply a side effect of your passions and not an inherent goal but youre a fascinating person to ask so much of our society at the individual level and at the company level and as nations is driven by the desire for wealth what do you think about this drive and what have you learned about if i may romanticize the notion the meaning of life having achieved success on so many dimensions there have been many studies of human happiness and above some threshold which is typically relatively low for this conversation theres no difference in happiness about money the happiness is correlated with meaning and purpose a sense of family a sense of impact so if you organize your life assuming you have enough to get around and have a nice home and so forth youll be far happier if you figure out what you care about and work on that its often being in service to others theres a great deal of evidence that people are happiest when theyre serving others and not themselves this goes directly against the sort of press induced excitement about powerful and wealthy leaders of one kind and indeed these are consequential people but if you are in a situation where youve been very fortunate as i have you also have to take that as a responsibility and you have to basically work both to educate others and give them that opportunity but also use that wealth to advance human society in my case im particularly interested in using the tools of artificial intelligence and machine learning to make society better ive mentioned education ive mentioned inequality and middle class and things like this all of which are a passion of mine it doesnt matter what you do it matters that you believe in it that its important to you and that your life will be far more satisfying if you spend your life doing that i think theres no better place to end than a discussion of the meaning of life eric thank you so much', 'the following is a conversation with stuart russell hes a professor of computer science at uc berkeley and a coauthor of a book that introduced me and millions of other people to the amazing world of ai called artificial intelligence a modern approach so it was an honor for me to have this conversation as part of mit course in artificial general intelligence and the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it please subscribe on youtube itunes or your podcast provider of choice or simply connect with me on twitter at lex friedman spelled f r i d and now heres my conversation with stuart russell so youve mentioned in 1975 in high school youve created one of your first ai programs that play chess were you ever able to build a program that beat you at chess or another board game so my program never beat me at chess i actually wrote the program at imperial college so i used to take the bus every wednesday with a box of cards this big and shove them into the card reader and they gave us eight seconds of cpu time it took about five seconds to read the cards in and compile the code so we had three seconds of cpu time which was enough to make one move you know with a not very deep search and then we would print that move out and then wed have to go to the back of the queue and wait to feed the cards in again how deep was the search are we talking about one move two moves three moves no i think we got an eight move a depth eight with alpha beta and we had some tricks of our own about move ordering and some pruning of the tree but you were still able to beat that program yeah yeah i was a reasonable chess player in my youth i did an othello program and a backgammon program so when i got to berkeley i worked a lot on what we call meta reasoning which really means reasoning about reasoning and in the case of a game playing program you need to reason about what parts of the search tree youre actually going to explore because the search tree is enormous bigger than the number of atoms in the universe and the way programs succeed and the way humans succeed is by only looking at a small fraction of the search tree and if you look at the right fraction you play really well if you look at the wrong fraction if you waste your time thinking about things that are never going to happen moves that no ones ever going to make then youre going to lose because you wont be able to figure out the right decision so that question of how machines can manage their own computation how they decide what to think about is the meta reasoning question and we developed some methods for doing that and very simply the machine should think about whatever thoughts are going to improve its decision quality we were able to show that both for othello which is a standard two player game and for backgammon which includes dice rolls so its a two player game with uncertainty for both of those cases we could come up with algorithms that were actually much more efficient than the standard alpha beta search which chess programs at the time were using and that those programs could beat me and i think you can see the same basic ideas in alpha go and alpha zero today the way they explore the tree is using a form of meta reasoning to select what to think about based on how useful it is to think about it is there any insights you can describe with our greek symbols of how do we select which paths to go down theres really two kinds of learning going on so as you say alpha go learns to evaluate board positions so it can look at a go board and it actually has probably a superhuman ability to instantly tell how promising that situation is to me the amazing thing about alpha go is not that it can be the world champion with its hands tied behind his back but the fact that if you stop it from searching altogether so you say okay youre not allowed to do any thinking ahead you can just consider each of your legal moves and then look at the resulting situation and evaluate it so what we call a depth one search so just the immediate outcome of your moves and decide if thats good or bad that version of alpha go can still play at a professional level and human professionals are sitting there for five 10 minutes deciding what to do and alpha go in less than a second can instantly intuit what is the right move to make based on its ability to evaluate positions and that is remarkable because we dont have that level of intuition about go we actually have to think about the situation so anyway that capability that alpha go has is one big part of why it beats humans the other big part is that its able to look ahead 40 50 60 moves into the future and if it was considering all possibilities 40 or 50 or 60 moves into the future that would be 10 to the 200 possibilities so way more than atoms in the universe and so on so its very very selective about what it looks at so let me try to give you an intuition about how you decide what to think about its a combination of two things one is how promising it is so if youre already convinced that a move is terrible theres no point spending a lot more time convincing yourself that its terrible because its probably not going to change your mind so the real reason you think is because theres some possibility of changing your mind about what to do and its that changing your mind that would result then in a better final action in the real world so thats the purpose of thinking is to improve the final action in the real world so if you think about a move that is guaranteed to be terrible you can convince yourself its terrible youre still not going to change your mind but on the other hand suppose you had a choice between two moves one of them youve already figured out is guaranteed to be a draw lets say and then the other one looks a little bit worse it looks fairly likely that if you make that move youre going to lose but theres still some uncertainty about the value of that move theres still some possibility that it will turn out to be a win then its worth thinking about that so even though its less promising on average than the other move which is a good move its worth thinking about on average than the other move which is guaranteed to be a draw theres still some purpose in thinking about it because theres a chance that you will change your mind and discover that in fact its a better move so its a combination of how good the move appears to be and how much uncertainty there is about its value the more uncertainty the more its worth thinking about because theres a higher upside if you want to think of it that way and of course in the beginning especially in the alphago zero formulation everything is shrouded in uncertainty so youre really swimming in a sea of uncertainty so it benefits you to i mean actually following the same process as you described but because youre so uncertain about everything you basically have to try a lot of different directions yeah so the early parts of the search tree are fairly bushy that it will look at a lot of different possibilities but fairly quickly the degree of certainty about some of the moves i mean if a move is really terrible youll pretty quickly find out right you lose half your pieces or half your territory and then youll say okay this is not worth thinking about anymore and then so further down the tree becomes very long and narrow and youre following various lines of play 10 20 30 40 50 moves into the future and that again is something that human beings have a very hard time doing mainly because they just lack the short term memory you just cant remember a sequence of moves thats 50 moves long and you cant imagine the board correctly for that many moves into the future of course the top players im much more familiar with chess but the top players probably have they have echoes of the same kind of intuition instinct that in a moments time alphago applies when they see a board i mean theyve seen those patterns human beings have seen those patterns before at the top at the grandmaster level it seems that there is some similarities or maybe its our imagination creates a vision of those similarities but it feels like this kind of pattern recognition that the alphago approaches are using is similar to what human beings at the top level are using i think theres theres some truth to that but not entirely yeah i mean i think the the extent to which a human grandmaster can reliably instantly recognize the right move and instantly recognize the value of the position i think thats a little bit overrated but if you sacrifice a queen for example i mean theres these theres these beautiful games of chess with bobby fischer somebody where its seeming to make a bad move and im not sure theres a perfect degree of calculation involved where theyve calculated all the possible things that happen but theres an instinct there right that somehow adds up to yeah so i think what happens is you you you get a sense that theres some possibility in the position even if you make a weird looking move that it opens up some some lines of of calculation that otherwise would be definitely bad and and its that intuition that theres something here in this position that might might yield a win and then you follow that right and and in some sense when a when a chess player is following a line and in his or her mind theyre theyre mentally simulating what the other person is going to do what the opponent is going to do and they can do that as long as the moves are kind of forced right as long as theres you know theres a a fort we call a forcing variation where the opponent doesnt really have much choice how to respond and then you follow that how to respond and then you see if you can force them into a situation where you win you know we see plenty of mistakes even even in grandmaster games where they just miss some simple three four five move combination that you know wasnt particularly apparent in in the position but was still there thats the thing that makes us human yeah so when you mentioned that in othello those games were after some matter reasoning improvements and research was able to beat you how did that make you feel part of the meta reasoning capability that it had was based on learning and and you could sit down the next day and you could just feel that it had got a lot smarter you know and all of a sudden you really felt like youre sort of pressed against the wall because it was it was much more aggressive and and was totally unforgiving of any minor mistake that you might make and and actually it seemed understood the game better than i did and gary kasparov has this quote where during his match against deep blue he said he suddenly felt that there was a new kind of intelligence across the board do you think thats a scary or an exciting possibility for for kasparov and for yourself in in the context of chess purely sort of in this like that feeling whatever that is i think its definitely an exciting feeling you know this is what made me work on ai in the first place was as soon as i really understood what a computer was i wanted to make it smart you know i started out with the first program i wrote was for the sinclair programmable calculator and i think you could write a 21 step algorithm that was the biggest program you could write something like that and do little arithmetic calculations so i think i implemented newtons method for a square roots and a few other things like that but then you know i thought okay if i just had more space i could make this thing intelligent and so i started thinking about ai and and i think the the the thing thats scary is not is not the chess program because you know chess programs theyre not in the taking over the world business but if you extrapolate you know there are things about chess that dont resemble the real world right we know we know the rules of chess the chess board is completely visible to the program where of course the real world is not most most of the real world is is not visible from wherever youre sitting so to speak and to overcome those kinds of problems you need qualitatively different algorithms another thing about the real world is that you know we we regularly plan ahead on the timescales involving billions or trillions of steps now we dont plan those in detail but you know when you choose to do a phd at berkeley thats a five year commitment and that amounts to about a trillion motor control steps that you will eventually be committed to including going up the stairs opening doors drinking water yeah i mean every every finger movement while youre typing every character of every paper and the thesis and everything so youre not committing in advance to the specific motor control steps but youre still reasoning on a timescale that will eventually reduce to trillions of motor control actions and so for all of these reasons you know alphago and deep blue and so on dont represent any kind of threat to humanity but they are a step towards it right and progress in ai occurs by essentially removing one by one these assumptions that make problems easy like the assumption of complete observability of the situation right we remove that assumption you need a much more complicated kind of computing design it needs it needs something that actually keeps track of all the things you cant see and tries to estimate whats going on and theres inevitable uncertainty in that so it becomes a much more complicated problem but you know we are removing those assumptions we are starting to have algorithms that can cope with much longer timescales that can cope with uncertainty that can cope with partial observability and so each of those steps sort of magnifies by a thousand the range of things that we can do with ai systems so the way i started in ai i wanted to be a psychiatrist for a long time i wanted to understand the mind in high school and of course program and so on and i showed up university of illinois to an ai lab and they said okay i dont have time for you but heres a book ai and modern approach i think it was the first edition at the time here go go go learn this and i remember the lay of the land was well its incredible that we solved chess but well never solve go i mean it was pretty certain that go in the way we thought about systems that reason wasnt possible to solve and now weve solved this so its a very well i think i would have said that its unlikely we could take the kind of algorithm that was used for chess and just get it to scale up and work well for go and at the time what we thought was that in order to solve go we would have to do something similar to the way humans manage the complexity of go which is to break it down into kind of sub games so when a human thinks about a go board they think about different parts of the board as sort of weakly connected to each other and they think about okay within this part of the board heres how things could go in that part of board heres how things could go and then you try to sort of couple those two analyses together and deal with the interactions and maybe revise your views of how things are going to go in each part and then youve got maybe five six seven ten parts of the board and that actually resembles the real world much more than chess does because in the real world we have work we have home life we have sport different kinds of activities shopping these all are connected to each other but theyre weakly connected so when im typing a paper i dont simultaneously have to decide which order im going to get the milk and the butter that doesnt affect the typing but i do need to realize okay i better finish this before the shops close because i dont have anything i dont have any food at home so theres some weak connection but not in the way that chess works where everything is tied into a single stream of thought so the thought was that to solve go wed have to make progress on stuff that would be useful for the real world and in a way alphago is a little bit disappointing right because the program designed for alphago is actually not that different from deep blue or even from arthur samuels checker playing program from the 1950s and in fact the two things that make alphago work is one is this amazing ability to evaluate the positions and the other is the meta reasoning capability which allows it to explore some paths in the tree very deeply and to abandon other paths very quickly including yourself because youre on camera now and your voice is coming through with high resolution yeah so you could take what im saying and replace it with pretty much anything else you wanted me to be saying and its a very simple thing take what im saying and replace it with pretty much anything else you wanted me to be saying and even it would change my lips and facial expressions to fit and theres actually not much in the way of real legal protection against that i think in the commercial area you could say yeah youre using my brand and so on there are rules about that but in the political sphere i think at the moment anything goes that could be really really damaging and let me just try to make not an argument but try to look back at history and say something dark in essence is while regulation seems to be oversight seems to be exactly the right thing to do here it seems that human beings what they naturally do is they wait for something to go wrong if youre talking about nuclear weapons you cant talk about nuclear weapons being dangerous until somebody actually like the united states drops the bomb or chernobyl melting do you think we will have to wait for things going wrong in a way thats obviously damaging to society not an existential risk but obviously damaging or do you have faith that i hope not but i think we do have to look at history and so the two examples you gave nuclear weapons and nuclear power are very very interesting because nuclear weapons we knew in the early years of the 20th century that atoms contained a huge amount of energy we had e equals mc squared we knew the mass differences between the different atoms and their components and we knew that you might be able to make an incredibly powerful explosive so hg wells wrote science fiction book i think in 1912 frederick soddy who was the guy who discovered isotopes the nobel prize winner he gave a speech in 1915 saying that one pound of this new explosive would be the equivalent of 150 tons of dynamite which turns out to be about right and this was in world war i so he was imagining how much worse the world war would be if we were using that kind of explosive but the physics establishment simply refused to believe that these things could be made including the people who are making it well so they were doing the nuclear physics i mean eventually were the ones who made it you talk about fermi or whoever well so up to the development was mostly theoretical so it was people using sort of primitive kinds of particle acceleration and doing experiments at the level of single particles or collections of particles they werent yet thinking about how to actually make a bomb or anything like that but they knew the energy was there and they figured if they understood it better it might be possible but the physics establishment their view and i think because they did not want it to be true their view was that it could not be true that this could not not provide a way to make a super weapon and there was this famous speech given by rutherford who was the sort of leader of nuclear physics and it was on september 11th 1933 and he said anyone who talks about the possibility of obtaining energy from transformation of atoms is talking complete moonshine and the next morning leo szilard read about that speech and then invented the nuclear chain reaction and so as soon as he invented as soon as he had that idea that you could make a chain reaction with neutrons because neutrons were not repelled by the nucleus so they could enter the nucleus and then continue the reaction as soon as he has that idea he instantly realized that the world was in deep doo doo because this is 1933 right hitler had recently come to power in germany szilard was in london and eventually became a refugee and came to the us and in the process of having the idea about the chain reaction he figured out basically how to make a bomb and also how to make a reactor and he patented the reactor in 1934 but because of the situation the great power conflict situation that he could see happening he kept that a secret and so between then and the beginning of world war ii people were working including the germans on how to actually create neutron sources what specific fission reactions would produce neutrons of the right energy to continue the reaction and that was demonstrated in germany i think in 1938 if i remember correctly the first nuclear weapon patent was 1939 by the french so this was actually going on well before world war ii really got going and then the british probably had the most advanced capability in this area but for safety reasons among others and just resources they moved the program from britain to the us and then that became manhattan project so the reason why we couldnt have any kind of oversight of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology was because we were basically already in an arms race and a war lr but you mentioned then in the 20s and 30s so what are the echoes the way youve described this story i mean theres clearly echoes why do you think most ai researchers folks who are really close to the metal they really are not concerned about ai they dont think about it whether its they dont want to think about it but why do you think that is is what are the echoes of the nuclear situation to the current ai situation and what can we do about it bf i think there is a kind of motivated cognition which is a term in psychology means that you believe what you would like to be true rather than what is true and its unsettling to think that what youre working on might be the end of the human race obviously so you would rather instantly deny it and come up with some reason why it couldnt be true and i have i collected a long list of reasons that extremely intelligent competent ai scientists have come up with for why we shouldnt worry about this for example calculators are superhuman at arithmetic and they havent taken over the world so theres nothing to worry about well okay my five year old you know could have figured out why that was an unreasonable and really quite weak argument another one was while its theoretically possible that you could have superhuman ai destroy the world its also theoretically possible that a black hole could materialize right next to the earth and destroy humanity i mean yes its theoretically possible quantum theoretically extremely unlikely that it would just materialize right there but thats a completely bogus analogy because you know if the whole physics community on earth was working to materialize a black hole in near earth orbit right wouldnt you ask them is that a good idea is that going to be safe you know what if you succeed right and thats the thing right the ai community is sort of refused to ask itself what if you succeed and initially i think that was because it was too hard but you know alan turing asked himself that and he said wed be toast right if we were lucky we might be able to switch off the power but probably wed be toast but theres also an aspect that because were not exactly sure what the future holds its not clear exactly so technically what to worry about sort of how things go wrong and so there is something it feels like maybe you can correct me if im wrong but theres something paralyzing about worrying about something that logically is inevitable but you have to think about it logically is inevitable but you dont really know what that will look like yeah i think thats its a reasonable point and you know its certainly in terms of existential risks its different from you know asteroid collides with the earth right which again is quite possible you know its happened in the past itll probably happen again we dont know right now but if we did detect an asteroid that was going to hit the earth in 75 years time wed certainly be doing something about it well its clear theres got big rock and theres well probably have a meeting and see what do we do about the big rock with ai right with ai i mean there are very few people who think its not going to happen within the next 75 years i know rod brooks doesnt think its going to happen maybe andrew ng doesnt think its happened but you know a lot of the people who work day to day you know as you say at the rock face they think its going to happen i think the median estimate from ai researchers is somewhere in 40 to 50 years from now or maybe you know i think in asia they think its going to be even faster than that im a little bit more conservative i think itd probably take longer than that but i think you know as happened with nuclear weapons it can happen overnight that you have these breakthroughs and we need more than one breakthrough but you know its on the order of half a dozen i mean this is a very rough scale but sort of half a dozen breakthroughs of that nature would have to happen for us to reach the superhuman ai but the you know the ai research community is vast now the massive investments from governments from corporations tons of really really smart people you know you just have to look at the rate of progress in different areas of ai to see that things are moving pretty fast so to say oh its just going to be thousands of years i dont see any basis for that you know i see you know for example the stanford 100 year ai project right which is supposed to be sort of you know the serious establishment view their most recent report actually said its probably not even possible oh wow right which if you want a perfect example of people in denial thats it because you know for the whole history of ai weve been saying to philosophers who said it wasnt possible well you have no idea what youre talking about of course its possible right give me an argument for why it couldnt happen and there isnt one right and now because people are worried that maybe ai might get a bad name or i just dont want to think about this theyre saying okay well of course its not really possible you know imagine if you know the leaders of the cancer biology community got up and said well you know of course curing cancer its not really possible thered be complete outrage and dismay and you know i find this really a strange phenomenon so okay so if you accept that its possible and if you accept that its probably going to happen the point that youre making that you know how does it go wrong a valid question without that without an answer to that question then youre stuck with what i call the gorilla problem which is you know the problem that the gorillas face right they made something more intelligent than them namely us a few million years ago and now theyre in deep doo doo so theres really nothing they can do theyve lost the control they failed to solve the control problem of controlling humans and so theyve lost so we dont want to be in that situation and if the gorilla problem is the only formulation you have theres not a lot you can do right other than to say okay we should try to stop you know we should just not make the humans or in this case not make the ai and i think thats really hard to do im not actually proposing that thats a feasible course of action i also think that you know if properly controlled ai could be incredibly beneficial but it seems to me that theres a consensus that one of the major failure modes is this loss of control that we create ai systems that are pursuing incorrect objectives and because the ai system believes it knows what the objective is it has no incentive to listen to us anymore so to speak right its just carrying out the strategy that it has computed as being the optimal solution and you know it may be that in the process it needs to acquire more resources to increase the possibility of success or prevent various failure modes by defending itself against interference and so that collection of problems i think is something we can address the other problems are roughly speaking you know misuse right so even if we solve the control problem we make perfectly safe controllable ai systems well why you know why does dr evil going to use those right he wants to just take over the world and hell make unsafe ai systems that then get out of control so thats one problem which is sort of a you know partly a policing problem partly a sort of a cultural problem for the profession of how we teach people what kinds of ai systems are safe you talk about autonomous weapon system and how pretty much everybody agrees that theres too many ways that that can go horribly wrong this great slaughterbots movie that kind of illustrates that beautifully i want to talk about that thats another theres another topic im having to talk about i just want to mention that what i see is the third major failure mode which is overuse not so much misuse but overuse of ai that we become overly dependent so i call this the wall e problem so if youve seen wall e the movie all right all the humans are on the spaceship and the machines look after everything for them and they just watch tv and drink big gulps and theyre all sort of obese and stupid and they sort of totally lost any notion of human autonomy and you know so in effect right this would happen like the slow boiling frog right we would gradually turn over more and more of the management of our civilization to machines as we are already doing and this you know if this if this process continues you know we sort of gradually switch from sort of being the masters of technology to just being the guests right so we become guests on a cruise ship you know which is fine for a week but not not for the rest of eternity you know and its almost irreversible right once you once you lose the incentive to for example you know learn to be an engineer or a doctor or a sanitation operative or any other of the infinitely many ways that we maintain and propagate our civilization you know if you if you dont have the incentive to do any of that you wont and then its really hard to recover and of course as just one of the technologies that could that third failure mode result in that theres probably other technology in general detaches us from it does a bit but the difference is that in terms of the knowledge to to run our civilization you know up to now weve had no alternative but to put it into peoples heads right and if you software with google i mean so software in general so computers in general but but the you know the knowledge of how you know how a sanitation system works you know thats an ai has to understand that its no good putting it into google so i mean we weve always put knowledge in on paper but paper doesnt run our civilization and only runs when it goes from the paper into peoples heads again right so weve always propagated civilization through human minds and weve spent about a trillion person years doing that i literally write you you can work it out its about right theres about just over 100 billion people whove ever lived and each of them has spent about 10 years learning stuff to keep their civilization going and so thats a trillion person years we put into this effort beautiful way to describe all civilization and now were you know were in danger of throwing that away so this is a problem that ai cant solve its not a technical problem its you know if we do our job right the ai systems will say you know the human race doesnt in the long run want to be passengers in a cruise ship the human race wants autonomy this is part of human preferences so we the ai systems are not going to do this stuff for you youve got to do it for yourself right im not going to carry you to the top of everest in an autonomous helicopter you have to climb it if you want to get the benefit and so on so but im afraid that because we are short sighted and lazy were going to override the ai systems and and theres an amazing short story that i recommend to everyone that i talked to about this called the machine stops written in 1909 by em forster who you know wrote novels about the british empire and sort of things that became costume dramas on the bbc but he wrote this one science fiction story which is an amazing vision of the future it has basically ipads it has video conferencing it has moocs it has computer induced obesity i mean literally its what people spend their time doing is giving online courses or listening to online courses and talking about ideas but they never get out there in the real world they dont really have a lot of face to face contact everything is done online you know so all the things were worrying about now were described in the story and and then the human race becomes more and more dependent on the machine loses knowledge of how things really run and then becomes vulnerable to collapse and so its a its a pretty unbelievably amazing story for someone writing in 1909 to imagine all this so theres very few people that represent artificial intelligence more than you stuart russell if you say its okay thats very kind so its all my fault right youre often brought up as the person well stuart russell like the ai person is worried about this thats why you should be worried about it do you feel the burden of that i dont know if you feel that at all but when i talk to people like from you talk about people outside of computer science when they think about this stuart russell is worried about ai safety you should be worried too do you feel the burden of that i mean in a practical sense yeah because i get you know a dozen sometimes 25 invitations a day to talk about it to give interviews to write press articles and so on so in that very practical sense im seeing that people are concerned and really interested about this are you worried that you could be wrong as all good scientists are of course i worry about that all the time i mean thats thats always been the way that i ive worked you know is like i have an argument in my head with myself right so i have i have some idea and then i think okay how could that be wrong or did someone else already have that idea so ill go and you know search in as much literature as i can to see whether someone else already thought of that or or even refuted it so you know i right now im im reading a lot of philosophy because you know in in the form of the debates over over utilitarianism and and other kinds of moral moral formulas shall we say people have already thought through some of these issues but you know what one of the things im im not seeing in a lot of these debates is this specific idea about the importance of uncertainty in the objective that this is the way we should think about machines that are beneficial to humans so this idea of provably beneficial machines based on explicit uncertainty in the objective you know it seems to be you know my gut feeling is this is the core of it its going to have to be elaborated in a lot of different directions and there are a lot of beneficial yeah but there there are i mean it has to be right we cant afford you know hand wavy beneficial because there are you know whenever we do hand wavy stuff there are loopholes and the thing about super intelligent machines is they find the loopholes you know just like you know tax evaders if you dont write your tax law properly people will find the loopholes and end up paying no tax and and so you should think of it this way and and getting those definitions right you know it is really a long process you know so you can you can define mathematical frameworks and within that framework you can prove mathematical theorems that yes this will you know this this theoretical entity will be provably beneficial to that theoretical entity but that framework may not match the real world in some crucial way so its a long process thinking through it iterating and so on last question yep you have 10 seconds to answer it what is your favorite sci fi movie about ai i would say interstellar has my favorite robots oh beats space yeah yeah yeah so so tars the robots one of the robots in interstellar is the way robot should behave and uh i would say ex machina is in some ways the one the one that makes you think uh in a nervous kind of way about about where were going well stuart thank you so much for talking today pleasure so this word meta reasoning while technically correct inspires perhaps the wrong degree of power that alphago has for example the word reasoning is a powerful word so let me ask you sort of you were part of the symbolic ai world for a while like ai was theres a lot of excellent interesting ideas there that unfortunately met a winter and so do you think it reemerges so i would say yeah its not quite as simple as that so the ai winter for the first winter that was actually named as such was the one in the late 80s and that came about because in the mid 80s there was a really a concerted attempt to push ai out into the real world using what was called expert system technology and for the most part that technology was just not ready for primetime they were trying in many cases to do a form of uncertain reasoning judgment combinations of evidence diagnosis those kinds of things which was simply invalid and when you try to apply invalid reasoning methods to real problems you can fudge it for small versions of the problem but when it starts to get larger the thing just falls apart so many companies found that the stuff just didnt work and they were spending tons of money on consultants to try to make it work and there were other practical reasons like they were asking the companies to buy incredibly expensive lisp machine workstations which were literally between 50000 and 100000 in 1980s money which would be like between 150000 and 300000 per workstation in current prices and then the bottom line they werent seeing a profit from it yeah in many cases i think there were some successes theres no doubt about that but people i would say overinvested every major company was starting an ai department just like now and i worry a bit that we might see similar disappointments not because the current technology is invalid but its limited in its scope and its almost the duel of the scope problems that expert systems had so what have you learned from that hype cycle and what can we do to prevent another winter for example yeah so when im giving talks these days thats one of the warnings that i give so this is a two part warning slide one is that rather than data being the new oil data is the new snake oil thats a good line and then the other is that we might see a kind of very visible failure in some of the major application areas and i think self driving cars would be the flagship and i think when you look at the history so the first self driving car was on the freeway driving itself changing lanes overtaking in 1987 and so its more than 30 years and that kind of looks like where we are today right you know prototypes on the freeway changing lanes and overtaking now i think thats one of the things thats been made particularly on the perception side so we worked a lot on autonomous vehicles in the early mid 90s at berkeley and we had our own big demonstrations we put congressmen into self driving cars and had them zooming along the freeway and the problem was clearly perception at the time the problem was perception yeah so in simulation with perfect perception you could actually show that you can drive safely for a long time even if the other cars are misbehaving and so on but simultaneously we worked on machine vision for detecting cars and tracking pedestrians and so on and we couldnt get the cars to do that and so we had to do that for pedestrians and so on and we couldnt get the reliability of detection and tracking up to a high enough level particularly in bad weather conditions nighttime rainfall good enough for demos but perhaps not good enough to cover the general operation yeah so the thing about driving is you know suppose youre a taxi driver you know and you drive every day eight hours a day for 10 years right thats 100 million seconds of driving you know and any one of those seconds you can make a fatal mistake so youre talking about eight nines of reliability right now if your vision system only detects 983 of the vehicles right then thats sort of you know one in a bit nines of reliability so you have another seven orders of magnitude to go and this is what people dont understand they think oh because i had a successful demo im pretty much done but youre not even within seven orders of magnitude of being done and thats the difficulty and its not the can i follow a white line thats not the problem right we follow a white line all the way across the country but its the weird stuff that happens its all the edge cases yeah the edge case other drivers doing weird things you know so if you talk to google right so they had actually a very classical architecture where you know you had machine vision which would detect all the other cars and pedestrians and the white lines and the road signs and then basically that was fed into a logical database and then you had a classical 1970s rule based expert system telling you okay if youre in the middle lane and theres a bicyclist in the right lane who is signaling this then you do that right and what they found was that every day theyd go out and thered be another situation that the rules didnt cover you know so theyd come to a traffic circle and theres a little girl riding her bicycle the wrong way around the traffic circle okay what do you do we dont have a rule oh my god okay stop and then you know they come back and add more rules and they just found that this was not really converging and if you think about it right how do you deal with an unexpected situation meaning one that youve never previously encountered and the sort of reasoning required to figure out the solution for that situation has never been done it doesnt match any previous situation in terms of the kind of reasoning you have to do well you know in chess programs this happens all the time right youre constantly coming up with situations you havent seen before and you have to reason about them and you have to think about okay here are the possible things i could do here are the outcomes heres how desirable the outcomes are and then pick the right one you know in the 90s we were saying okay this is how youre going to have to do automated vehicles theyre going to have to have a look ahead capability but the look ahead for driving is more difficult than it is for chess because theres humans and theyre less predictable than chess pieces well then you have an opponent in chess whos also somewhat unpredictable but for example in chess you always know the opponents intention theyre trying to beat you right whereas in driving you dont know is this guy trying to turn left or has he just forgotten to turn off his turn signal or is he drunk or is he changing the channel on his radio or whatever it might be youve got to try and figure out the mental state the intent of the other drivers to forecast the possible evolutions of their trajectories and then youve got to figure out okay which is the trajectory for me thats going to be safest and those all interact with each other because the other drivers are going to react to your trajectory and so on so you know theyve got the classic merging onto the freeway problem where youre kind of racing a vehicle thats already on the freeway and youre going to pull ahead of them or youre going to let them go first and pull in behind and you get this sort of uncertainty about whos going first so all those kinds of things mean that you need a decision making architecture thats very different from either a rule based system or it seems to me kind of an end to end neural network system so just as alphago is pretty good when it doesnt do any look ahead but its way way way way better when it does i think the same is going to be true for driving you can have a driving system thats pretty good when it doesnt do any look ahead but thats not good enough and weve already seen multiple deaths caused by poorly designed machine learning algorithms that dont really understand what theyre doing yeah on several levels i think on the perception side theres mistakes being made by those algorithms where the perception is very shallow on the planning side the look ahead like you said and the thing that we come up against thats really interesting when you try to deploy systems in the real world is you cant think of an artificial intelligence system as a thing that responds to the world always you have to realize that its an agent that others will respond to as well so in order to drive successfully you cant just try to do obstacle avoidance right you cant pretend that youre invisible right youre the invisible car right it doesnt work that way i mean but you have to assert yet others have to be scared of you just were all theres this tension theres this game so if we study a lot of work with pedestrians if you approach pedestrians as purely an obstacle avoidance so youre doing look ahead as in modeling the intent that theyre not going to theyre going to take advantage of you theyre not going to respect you at all there has to be a tension a fear some amount of uncertainty thats how we have created or at least just a kind of a resoluteness you have to display a certain amount of resoluteness you cant be too tentative and yeah so the solutions then become pretty complicated right you get into game theoretic analyses and so at berkeley now were working a lot on this kind of interaction between machines and humans and thats exciting and so my colleague ankur dragan actually if you formulate the problem game theoretically you just let the system figure out the solution it does interesting unexpected things like sometimes at a stop sign if no one is going first the car will actually back up a little right and just to indicate to the other cars that they should go and thats something it invented entirely by itself we didnt say this is the language of communication at stop signs it figured it out thats really interesting so let me one just step back for a second just this beautiful philosophical notion so pamela mccordick in 1979 wrote ai began with the ancient wish to forge the gods so when you think about the history of our civilization do you think that there is an inherent desire to create lets not say gods but to create superintelligence is it inherent to us is it in our genes that the natural arc of human civilization is to create things that are of greater and greater power and perhaps echoes of ourselves so to create the gods as pamela said maybe i mean were all individuals but certainly we see over and over again in history individuals who thought about this possibility hopefully when im not being too philosophical here but if you look at the arc of this where this is going and well talk about ai safety well talk about greater and greater intelligence do you see that there in when you created the othello program and you felt this excitement what was that excitement was it excitement of a tinkerer who created something cool like a clock or was there a magic or was it more like a child being born yeah so i mean i certainly understand that viewpoint and if you look at the lighthill report which was so in the 70s there was a lot of controversy in the uk about ai and whether it was for real and how much money the government should invest and there was a long story but the government commissioned a report by lighthill who was a physicist and he wrote a very damning report about ai which i think was the point and he said that these are frustrated men who are unable to have children would like to create and create a life as a kind of replacement which i think is really pretty unfair but there is a kind of magic i would say when you build something and what youre building in is really just youre building in some understanding of the principles of learning and decision making and to see those principles actually then turn into intelligent behavior in specific situations its an incredible thing and that is naturally going to make you think okay where does this end and so theres magical optimistic views of where it ends whatever your view of optimism is whatever your view of utopia is its probably different for everybody but youve often talked about concerns you have of how things may go wrong so ive talked to max tegmark theres a lot of interesting ways to think about ai safety youre one of the seminal people thinking about this problem amongst sort of being in the weeds of actually solving specific ai problems youre also thinking about the big picture of where are we going so can you talk about several elements of it lets just talk about maybe the control problem so this idea of losing ability to control the behavior in our ai system so how do you see that how do you see that coming about what do you think we can do to manage it well so it doesnt take a genius to realize that if you make something thats smarter than you you might have a problem alan turing wrote about this and gave lectures about this in 1951 he did a lecture on the radio and he basically says once the machine thinking method starts very quickly theyll outstrip humanity and if were lucky we might be able to turn off the power at strategic moments but even so our species would be humbled actually he was wrong about that if its sufficiently intelligent machine its not going to let you switch it off its actually in competition with you so what do you think is most likely going to happen what do you think is meant just for a quick tangent if we shut off this super intelligent machine that our species will be humbled i think he means that we would realize that we are inferior right that we only survive by the skin of our teeth because we happen to get to the off switch just in time and if we hadnt then we would have lost control over the earth are you more worried when you think about this stuff about super intelligent ai or are you more worried about super powerful ai thats not aligned with our values so the paperclip scenarios kind of so the main problem im working on is the control problem the problem of machines pursuing objectives that are as you say not aligned with human objectives and this has been the way weve thought about ai since the beginning you build a machine for optimizing and then you put in some objective and it optimizes right and we can think of this as the king midas problem right because if the king midas put in this objective everything i touch should turn to gold and the gods thats like the machine they said okay done you now have this power and of course his father his drink and his family all turned to gold and then he dies of misery and starvation and its a warning its a failure mode that pretty much every culture in history has had some story along the same lines theres the genie that gives you three wishes and the third wish is always you know please undo the first two wishes because i messed up and when arthur samuel wrote his checker playing program which learned to play checkers considerably better than arthur samuel could play and actually reached a pretty decent standard norbert wiener who was one of the major mathematicians of the 20th century hes sort of the father of modern automation control systems he saw this and he basically extrapolated as turing did and said okay this is how we could lose control and specifically that we have to be certain that the purpose we put into the machine is the purpose which we really desire and the problem is we cant do that you mean were not its a very difficult to encode to put our values on paper is really difficult or youre just saying its impossible so theoretically its possible but in practice its extremely unlikely that we could specify correctly in advance the full range of concerns of humanity you talked about cultural transmission of values i think is how humans to human transmission of values happens right well we learn yeah i mean as we grow up we learn about the values that matter how things should go what is reasonable to pursue and what isnt reasonable to pursue you think machines can learn in the same kind of way yeah so i think that what we need to do is to get away from this idea that you build an optimising machine and then you put the objective into it because if its possible that you might put in a wrong objective and we already know this is possible because its happened lots of times right that means that the machine should never take an objective thats given as gospel truth because once it takes the objective as gospel truth then it believes that whatever actions its taking in pursuit of that objective are the correct things to do so you could be jumping up and down and saying no no no no youre going to destroy the world but the machine knows what the true objective is and is pursuing it and tough luck to you and this is not restricted to ai right this is i think many of the 20th century technologies right so in statistics you minimise a loss function the loss function is exogenously specified in control theory you minimise a cost function in operations research you maximise a reward function and so on so in all these disciplines this is how we conceive of the problem and its the wrong problem because we cannot specify with certainty the correct objective right we need uncertainty we need the machine to be uncertain about what it is that its supposed to be maximising favourite idea of yours ive heard you say somewhere well i shouldnt pick favourites but it just sounds beautiful we need to teach machines humility its a beautiful way to put it i love it that theyre humble they know that they dont know what it is theyre supposed to be doing and that those objectives i mean they exist theyre within us but we may not be able to we may not be able to explicate them we may not even know how we want our future to go exactly and the machine a machine thats uncertain is going to be deferential to us so if we say dont do that well now the machines learn something a bit more about our true objectives because something that it thought was reasonable in pursuit of our objective turns out not to be so now its learned something so its going to defer because it wants to be doing what we really want and that point i think is absolutely central to solving the control problem and its a different kind of ai when you take away this idea that the objective is known then in fact a lot of the theoretical frameworks that were so familiar with you know markov decision processes goal based planning you know standard games research all of these techniques actually become inapplicable and you get a more complicated problem because now the interaction with the human becomes part of the problem because the human by making choices is giving you more information about the true objective and that information helps you achieve the objective better and so that really means that youre mostly dealing with game theoretic problems where youve got the machine and the human and theyre coupled together rather than a machine going off by itself with a fixed objective lw which is fascinating on the machine and the human level that we when you dont have an objective means youre together coming up with an objective i mean theres a lot of philosophy that you know you could argue that life doesnt really have meaning we together agree on what gives it meaning and we kind of culturally create things that give why the heck we are on this earth anyway we together as a society create that meaning and you have to learn that objective and one of the biggest i thought thats where you were going to go for a second one of the biggest troubles we run into outside of statistics and machine learning and ai and just human civilization is when you look at i came from i was born in the soviet union and the history of the 20th century we ran into the most trouble us humans when there was a certainty about the objective and you do whatever it takes to achieve that objective whether youre talking about germany or communist russia you get into trouble with humans i would say with you know corporations in fact some people argue that you know we dont have to look forward to a time when ai systems take over the world they already have and they call corporations right that corporations happen to be using people as components right now but they are effectively algorithmic machines and theyre optimizing an objective which is quarterly profit that isnt aligned with overall wellbeing of the human race and they are destroying the world they are primarily responsible for our inability to tackle climate change so i think thats one way of thinking about whats going on with corporations but i think the point youre making is valid that there are many systems in the real world where weve sort of prematurely fixed on the objective and then decoupled the machine from those thats supposed to be serving and i think you see this with government right government is supposed to be a machine that serves people but instead it tends to be taken over by people who have their own objective and use government to optimize that objective regardless of what people want do you find appealing the idea of almost arguing machines where you have multiple ai systems with a clear fixed objective we have in government the red team and the blue team theyre very fixed on their objectives and they argue and they kind of may disagree but it kind of seems to make it work somewhat that the duality of it okay lets go a hundred years back when there was still was going on or at the founding of this country there was disagreements and that disagreement is where so it was a balance between certainty and forced humility because the power was distributed yeah i think that the nature of debate and disagreement argument takes as a premise the idea that you could be wrong which means that youre not necessarily absolutely convinced that your objective is the correct one if you were absolutely convinced thered be no point in having any discussion or argument because you would never change your mind and there wouldnt be any sort of synthesis or anything like that i think you can think of argumentation as an implementation of a form of uncertain reasoning ive been reading recently about utilitarianism and the history of efforts to define in a sort of clear mathematical way if you like a formula for moral or political decision making its really interesting that the parallels between the philosophical discussions going back 200 years and what you see now in discussions about existential risk because its almost exactly the same someone would say okay well heres a formula for how we should make decisions utilitarianism is roughly each person has a utility function and then we make decisions to maximize the sum of everybodys utility then people point out well in that case the best policy is one that leads to the enormously vast population all of whom are living a life thats barely worth living this is called the repugnant conclusion another version is that we should maximize pleasure and thats what we mean by utility then youll get people effectively saying well in that case we might as well just have everyone hooked up to a heroin drip they didnt use those words but that debate was happening in the 19th century as it is now about ai that if we get the formula wrong were going to have ai systems working towards an outcome that in retrospect would be exactly wrong do you think theres as beautifully put so the echoes are there but do you think i mean if you look at sam harris our imagination worries about the ai version of that because of the speed at which the things going wrong in the utilitarian context could happen is that a worry for you yeah i think that in most cases not in all but if we have a wrong political idea we see it starting to go wrong and were not completely stupid and so we say okay maybe that was a mistake lets try something different also were very slow and inefficient about implementing these things and so on so you have to worry when you have corporations or political systems that are extremely efficient but when we look at ai systems or even just computers in general they have this different characteristic from ordinary human activity in the past so lets say you were a surgeon you had some idea about how to do some operation well and lets say you were wrong that way of doing the operation would mostly kill the patient well youd find out pretty quickly like after three maybe three or four tries but that isnt true for pharmaceutical companies because they dont do three or four operations they manufacture three or four billion pills and they sell them and then they find out maybe six months or a year later that oh people are dying of heart attacks or getting cancer from this drug and so thats why we have the fda right because of the scalability of pharmaceutical production and there have been some unbelievably bad episodes in the history of pharmaceuticals and adulteration of products and so on that have killed tens of thousands or paralyzed hundreds of thousands of people now with computers we have that same scalability problem that you can sit there and type for i equals one to five billion do right and all of a sudden youre having an impact on a global scale and yet we have no fda right theres absolutely no controls at all over what a bunch of undergraduates with too much caffeine can do to the world and we look at what happened with facebook well social media in general and click through optimization so you have a simple feedback algorithm thats trying to just optimize click through right that sounds reasonable right because you dont want to be feeding people ads that they dont care about or not interested in and you might even think of that process as simply adjusting the feeding of ads or news articles or whatever it might be to match peoples preferences right which sounds like a good idea but in fact that isnt how the algorithm works right you make more money the algorithm makes more money if it can better predict what people are going to click on because then it can feed them exactly that right so the way to maximize click through is actually to modify the people to make them more predictable and one way to do that is to feed them information which will change their behavior and preferences towards extremes that make them predictable whatever is the nearest extreme or the nearest predictable point thats where youre going to end up and the machines will force you there and i think theres a reasonable argument to say that this among other things is contributing to the destruction of democracy in the world and where was the oversight of this process where were the people saying okay you would like to apply this algorithm to 5 billion people on the face of the earth can you show me that its safe can you show me that it wont have various kinds of negative effects no there was no one asking that question there was no one placed between the undergrads with too much caffeine and the human race they just did it but some way outside the scope of my knowledge so economists would argue that the what is it the invisible hand so the capitalist system it was the oversight so if youre going to corrupt society with whatever decision you make as a company then thats going to be reflected in people not using your product thats one model of oversight we shall see but in the meantime but you might even have broken the political system that enables capitalism to function well youve changed it we shall see change is often painful so my question is absolutely its fascinating youre absolutely right that there was zero oversight on algorithms that can have a profound civilization changing effect so do you think its possible i mean i havent have you seen government so do you think its possible to create regulatory bodies oversight over ai algorithms which are inherently such cutting edge set of ideas and technologies yeah but i think it takes time to figure out what kind of oversight what kinds of controls i mean it took time to design the fda regime you know and some people still dont like it and they want to fix it and i think there are clear ways that it could be improved but the whole notion that you have stage one stage two stage three and here are the criteria for what you have to do to pass a stage one trial right we havent even thought about what those would be for algorithms so i mean i think there are things we could do right now with regard to bias for example we have a pretty good technical handle on how to detect algorithms that are propagating bias that exists in data sets how to de bias those algorithms and even what its going to cost you to do that so i think we could start having some standards on that i think there are things to do with impersonation and falsification that we could work on fakes yeah a very simple point so impersonation is a machine acting as if it was a person i cant see a real justification for why we shouldnt insist that machines self identify as machines where is the social benefit in fooling people into thinking that this is really a person when it isnt i dont mind if it uses a human like voice thats easy to understand thats fine but it should just say im a machine in some form and how many people are speaking to that i would think relatively obvious facts yeah i mean there is actually a law in california that bans impersonation but only in certain restricted circumstances so for the purpose of engaging in a fraudulent transaction and for the purpose of modifying someones voting behavior so those are the circumstances where machines have to self identify but i think arguably it should be in all circumstances and then when you talk about deep fakes were just at the beginning but already its possible to make a movie of anybody saying anything in ways that are pretty hard to detect', 'the following is a conversation with peter abbeel hes a professor at uc berkeley and the director of the berkeley robotics learning lab hes one of the top researchers in the world working on how we make robots understand and interact with the world around them especially using imitation and deep reinforcement learning this conversation is part of the mit course on artificial general intelligence and the artificial intelligence podcast if you enjoy it please subscribe on youtube itunes or your podcast provider of choice or simply connect with me on twitter at lex friedman spelled f r i d and now heres my conversation with peter abbeel youve mentioned that if there was one person you could meet it would be roger federer so let me ask when do you think well have a robot that fully autonomously can beat roger federer at tennis roger federer level player at tennis well first if you can make it happen for me to meet roger let me know in terms of getting a robot to beat him at tennis its kind of an interesting question because for a lot of the challenges we think about in ai the software is really the missing piece but for something like this the hardware is nowhere near either to really have a robot that can physically run around the boston dynamics robots are starting to get there but still not really human level ability to run around and then swing a racket so you think thats a hardware problem i dont think its a hardware problem only i think its a hardware and a software problem i think its both and i think theyll have independent progress so id say the hardware maybe in 10 15 years on clay not grass i mean grass is probably harder with the sliding yeah with the clay im not sure whats harder grass or clay the clay involves sliding which might be harder to master actually yeah but youre not limited to a bipedal i mean im sure theres no well if we can build a machine its a whole different question of course if you can say okay this robot can be on wheels it can move around on wheels and can be designed differently then i think that can be done sooner probably than a full humanoid type of setup what do you think of swing a racket so youve worked at basic manipulation how hard do you think is the task of swinging a racket would be able to hit a nice backhand or a forehand lets say we just set up stationary a nice robot arm lets say a standard industrial arm and it can watch the ball come and then swing the racket its a good question im not sure it would be super hard to do i mean im sure it would require a lot if we do it with reinforcement learning it would require a lot of trial and error its not gonna swing it right the first time around but yeah i dont see why i couldnt swing it the right way i think its learnable i think if you set up a ball machine lets say on one side and then a robot with a tennis racket on the other side i think its learnable and maybe a little bit of pre training and simulation yeah i think thats feasible i think the swing the racket is feasible itd be very interesting to see how much precision it can get cause i mean thats where i mean some of the human players can hit it on the lines which is very high precision with spin the spin is an interesting whether rl can learn to put a spin on the ball well you got me interested maybe someday well set this up sure you got me intrigued your answer is basically okay for this problem it sounds fascinating but for the general problem of a tennis player we might be a little bit farther away whats the most impressive thing youve seen a robot do in the physical world so physically for me its the boston dynamics videos always just bring home and just super impressed recently the robot running up the stairs doing the parkour type thing i mean yes we dont know whats underneath they dont really write a lot of detail but even if its hard coded underneath which it might or might not be just the physical abilities of doing that parkour thats a very impressive so have you met spot mini or any of those robots in person met spot mini last year in april at the mars event that jeff bezos organizes they brought it out there and it was nicely following around jeff when jeff left the room they had it follow him along which is pretty impressive so i think theres some confidence to know that theres no learning going on in those robots the psychology of it so while knowing that while knowing theres not if theres any learning going on its very limited i met spot mini earlier this year and knowing everything thats going on having one on one interaction so i got to spend some time alone and theres immediately a deep connection on the psychological level even though you know the fundamentals how it works theres something magical so do you think about the psychology of interacting with robots in the physical world even you just showed me the pr2 the robot and there was a little bit something like a face had a little bit something like a face theres something that immediately draws you to it do you think about that aspect of the robotics problem well its very hard with brad here well give him a name berkeley robot for the elimination of tedious tasks its very hard to not think of the robot as a person and it seems like everybody calls him a he for whatever reason but that also makes it more a person than if it was a it and it seems pretty natural to think of it that way this past weekend really struck me ive seen pepper many times on videos but then i was at an event organized by this was by fidelity and they had scripted pepper to help moderate some sessions and they had scripted pepper to have the personality of a child a little bit and it was very hard to not think of it as its own person in some sense because it would just jump in the conversation making it very interactive moderate would be saying pepper would just jump in hold on how about me can i participate in this too and youre just like okay this is like a person and that was 100 scripted and even then it was hard not to have that sense of somehow there is something there so as we have robots interact in this physical world is that a signal that could be used in reinforcement learning youve worked a little bit in this direction but do you think that psychology can be somehow pulled in yes thats a question i would say a lot of people ask and i think part of why they ask it is theyre thinking about how unique are we really still as people like after they see some results they see a computer play go they see a computer do this that theyre like okay but can it really have emotion can it really interact with us in that way and then once youre around robots you already start feeling it and i think that kind of maybe mythologically the way that i think of it is if you run something like reinforcement learning its about optimizing some objective and theres no reason that the objective couldnt be tied into how much does a person like interacting with this system and why could not the reinforcement learning system optimize for the robot being fun to be around and why wouldnt it then naturally become more and more interactive and more and more maybe like a person or like a pet i dont know what it would exactly be but more and more have those features and acquire them automatically as long as you can formalize an objective of what it means to like something what how you exhibit whats the ground truth how do you get the reward from human because you have to somehow collect that information within you human but youre saying if you can formulate as an objective it can be learned theres no reason it couldnt emerge through learning and maybe one way to formulate as an objective you wouldnt have to necessarily score it explicitly so standard rewards are numbers and numbers are hard to come by this is a 15 or a 17 on some scale its very hard to do for a person but much easier is for a person to say okay what you did the last five minutes was much nicer than what you did the previous five minutes and that now gives a comparison and in fact there have been some results on that for example paul christiano and collaborators at openai had the hopper mojoko hopper a one legged robot going through backflips purely from feedback i like this better than that thats kind of equally good and after a bunch of interactions it figured out what it was the person was asking for namely a backflip and so i think the same thing oh it wasnt trying to do a backflip it was just getting a comparison score from the person based on person having in mind in their own mind i wanted to do a backflip but the robot didnt know what it was supposed to be doing it just knew that sometimes the person said this is better this is worse and then the robot figured out what the person was actually after was a backflip and id imagine the same would be true for things like more interactive robots that the robot would figure out over time oh this kind of thing apparently is appreciated more than this other kind of thing so when i first picked up suttons richard suttons reinforcement learning book before sort of this deep learning before the reemergence of neural networks as a powerful mechanism for machine learning rl seemed to me like magic it was beautiful so that seemed like what intelligence is rl reinforcement learning so how do you think we can possibly learn anything about the world when the reward for the actions is delayed is so sparse like where is why do you think rl works why do you think you can learn anything under such sparse rewards whether its regular reinforcement learning or deep reinforcement learning whats your intuition the counterpart of that is why is rl why does it need so many samples so many experiences to learn from because really whats happening is when you have a sparse reward you do something maybe for like i dont know you take 100 actions and then you get a reward and maybe you get like a score of three and im like okay three not sure what that means you go again and now you get two and now you know that that sequence of 100 actions that you did the second time around somehow was worse than the sequence of 100 actions you did the first time around but thats tough to now know which one of those were better or worse some might have been good and bad in either one and so thats why it needs so many experiences but once you have enough experiences effectively rl is teasing that apart its trying to say okay what is consistently there when you get a higher reward and whats consistently there when you get a lower reward and then kind of the magic of sometimes the policy gradient update is to say now lets update the neural network to make the actions that were kind of present when things are good more likely and make the actions that are present when things are not as good less likely so that is the counterpoint but it seems like you would need to run it a lot more than you do even though right now people could say that rl is very inefficient but it seems to be way more efficient than one would imagine on paper that the simple updates to the policy the policy gradient that somehow you can learn exactly you just said what are the common actions that seem to produce some good results that that somehow can learn anything it seems counterintuitive at least is there some intuition behind it yeah so i think theres a few ways to think about this the way i tend to think about it mostly originally so when we started working on deep reinforcement learning here at berkeley which was maybe 2011 12 13 around that time john schulman was a phd student initially kind of driving it forward here and the way we thought about it at the time was if you think about rectified linear units or kind of rectifier type neural networks what do you get you get something thats piecewise linear feedback control and if you look at the literature linear feedback control is extremely successful can solve many many problems surprisingly well i remember for example when we did helicopter flight if youre in a stationary flight regime not a non stationary but a stationary flight regime like hover you can use linear feedback control to stabilize a helicopter very complex dynamical system but the controller is relatively simple and so i think thats a big part of it is that if you do feedback control even though the system you control can be very very complex often relatively simple control architectures can already do a lot but then also just linear is not good enough and so one way you can think of these neural networks is that sometimes they tile the space which people were already trying to do more by hand or with finite state machines say this linear controller here this linear controller here neural network learns to tile the space and say linear controller here another linear controller here but its more subtle than that and so its benefiting from this linear control aspect its benefiting from the tiling but its somehow tiling it one dimension at a time because if lets say you have a two layer network if in that hidden layer you make a transition from active to inactive or the other way around that is essentially one axis but not axis aligned but one direction that you change and so you have this kind of very gradual tiling of the space where you have a lot of sharing between the linear controllers that tile the space and that was always my intuition as to why to expect that this might work pretty well its essentially leveraging the fact that linear feedback control is so good but of course not enough and this is a gradual tiling of the space with linear feedback controls that share a lot of expertise across them so thats really nice intuition but do you think that scales to the more and more general problems of when you start going up the number of dimensions when you start going down in terms of how often you get a clean reward signal does that intuition carry forward to those crazier weirder worlds that we think of as the real world so i think where things get really tricky in the real world compared to the things weve looked at so far with great success in reinforcement learning is the time scales which takes us to an extreme so when you think about the real world i mean i dont know maybe some student decided to do a phd here right okay thats a decision thats a very high level decision but if you think about their lives i mean any persons life its a sequence of muscle fiber contractions and relaxations and thats how you interact with the world and thats a very high frequency control thing but its ultimately what you do and how you affect the world until i guess we have brain readings and you can maybe do it slightly differently but typically thats how you affect the world and the decision of doing a phd is so abstract relative to what youre actually doing in the world and i think thats where credit assignment becomes just completely beyond what any current rl algorithm can do and we need hierarchical reasoning at a level that is just not available at all yet where do you think we can pick up hierarchical reasoning by which mechanisms yeah so maybe let me highlight what i think the limitations are of what already was done 20 30 years ago in fact youll find reasoning systems that reason over relatively long horizons but the problem is that they were not grounded in the real world so people would have to hand design some kind of logical dynamical descriptions of the world and that didnt tie into perception and so it didnt tie into real objects and so forth and so that was a big gap now with deep learning we start having the ability to really see with sensors process that and understand whats in the world and so its a good time to try to bring these things together i see a few ways of getting there one way to get there would be to say deep learning can get bolted on somehow to some of these more traditional approaches now bolted on would probably mean you need to do some kind of end to end training where you say my deep learning processing somehow leads to a representation that in term uses some kind of traditional underlying dynamical systems that can be used for planning and thats for example the direction aviv tamar and thanard kuretach here have been pushing with causal info again and of course other people too thats one way can we somehow force it into the form factor that is amenable to reasoning another direction weve been thinking about for a long time and didnt make any progress on was more information theoretic approaches so the idea there was that what it means to take high level action is to take and choose a latent variable now that tells you a lot about whats gonna be the case in the future because thats what it means to take a high level action i say okay i decide im gonna navigate to the gas station because i need to get gas for my car well thatll now take five minutes to get there but the fact that i get there i could already tell that from the high level action i took much earlier that we had a very hard time getting success with not saying its a dead end necessarily but we had a lot of trouble getting that to work and then we started revisiting the notion of what are we really trying to achieve what were trying to achieve is not necessarily hierarchy per se but you could think about what does hierarchy give us what we hope it would give us is better credit assignment what is better credit assignment its giving us it gives us faster learning right and so faster learning is ultimately maybe what were after and so thats where we ended up with the rl squared paper on learning to reinforcement learn which at a time rocky dwan led and thats exactly the meta learning approach where you say okay we dont know how to design hierarchy we know what we want to get from it lets just enter and optimize for what we want to get from it and see if it might emerge and we saw things emerge the maze navigation had consistent motion down hallways which is what you want a hierarchical control should say i want to go down this hallway and then when there is an option to take a turn i can decide whether to take a turn or not and repeat even had the notion of where have you been before or not to not revisit places youve been before it still didnt scale yet to the real world kind of scenarios i think you had in mind but it was some sign of life that maybe you can meta learn these hierarchical concepts i mean it seems like through these meta learning concepts get at the what i think is one of the hardest and most important problems of ai which is transfer learning so its generalization how far along this journey towards building general systems are we being able to do transfer learning well so theres some signs that you can generalize a little bit but do you think were on the right path or its totally different breakthroughs are needed to be able to transfer knowledge between different learned models yeah im pretty torn on this in that i think there are some very impressive well theres just some very impressive results already i mean i would say when even with the initial kind of big breakthrough in 2012 with alexnet the initial thing is okay great this does better on imagenet hence image recognition but then immediately thereafter there was of course the notion that wow what was learned on imagenet and you now wanna solve a new task you can fine tune alexnet for new tasks and that was often found to be the even bigger deal that you learn something that was reusable which was not often the case before usually machine learning you learn something for one scenario and that was it and thats really exciting i mean thats a huge application thats probably the biggest success of transfer learning today in terms of scope and impact that was a huge breakthrough and then recently i feel like similar kind of by scaling things up it seems like this has been expanded upon like people training even bigger networks they might transfer even better if you looked at for example some of the openai results on language models and some of the recent google results on language models theyre learned for just prediction and then they get reused for other tasks and so i think there is something there where somehow if you train a big enough model on enough things it seems to transfer some deep mind results that i thought were very impressive the unreal results where it was learned to navigate mazes in ways where it wasnt just doing reinforcement learning but it had other objectives it was optimizing for so i think theres a lot of interesting results already i think maybe where its hard to wrap my head around this to which extent or when do we call something generalization or the levels of generalization in the real world or the levels of generalization involved in these different tasks right you draw this by the way just to frame things ive heard you say somewhere its the difference between learning to master versus learning to generalize that its a nice line to think about and i guess youre saying that its a gray area of what learning to master and learning to generalize where one starts i think i might have heard this i might have heard it somewhere else and i think it mightve been one of your interviews maybe the one with yoshua benjamin im not 100 sure but i liked the example im not sure who it was but the example was essentially if you use current deep learning techniques what were doing to predict lets say the relative motion of our planets it would do pretty well but then now if a massive new mass enters our solar system it would probably not predict what will happen right and thats a different kind of generalization thats a generalization that relies on the ultimate simplest simplest explanation that we have available today to explain the motion of planets whereas just pattern recognition could predict our current solar system motion pretty well no problem and so i think thats an example of a kind of generalization that is a little different from what weve achieved so far and its not clear if just regularizing more and forcing it to come up with a simpler simpler simpler explanation and say look this is not simple but thats what physics researchers do right they say can i make this even simpler how simple can i get this whats the simplest equation that can explain everything the master equation for the entire dynamics of the universe we havent really pushed that direction as hard in deep learning i would say not sure if it should be pushed but it seems a kind of generalization you get from that that you dont get in our current methods so far so i just talked to vladimir vapnik for example whos a statistician of statistical learning and he kind of dreams of creating the e equals mc squared for learning right the general theory of learning do you think thats a fruitless pursuit in the near term within the next several decades i think thats a really interesting pursuit in the following sense in that there is a lot of evidence that the brain is pretty modular and so i wouldnt maybe think of it as the theory maybe the underlying theory but more kind of the principle where there have been findings where people who are blind will use the part of the brain usually used for vision for other functions and even after some kind of if people get rewired in some way they might be able to reuse parts of their brain for other functions and so what that suggests is some kind of modularity and i think it is a pretty natural thing to strive for to see can we find that modularity can we find this thing of course every part of the brain is not exactly the same not everything can be rewired arbitrarily but if you think of things like the neocortex which is a pretty big part of the brain that seems fairly modular from what the findings so far can you design something equally modular and if you can just grow it it becomes more capable probably i think that would be the kind of interesting underlying principle to shoot for that is not unrealistic do you think you prefer math or empirical trial and error for the discovery of the essence of what it means to do something intelligent so reinforcement learning embodies both groups right to prove that something converges prove the bounds and then at the same time a lot of those successes are well lets try this and see if it works so which do you gravitate towards how do you think of those two parts of your brain maybe i would prefer we could make the progress with mathematics and the reason maybe i would prefer that is because often if you have something you can mathematically formalize you can leapfrog a lot of experimentation and experimentation takes a long time to get through and a lot of trial and error kind of reinforcement learning your research process but you need to do a lot of trial and error before you get to a success so if you can leapfrog that to my mind thats what the math is about and hopefully once you do a bunch of experiments you start seeing a pattern you can do some derivations that leapfrog some experiments but i agree with you i mean in practice a lot of the progress has been such that we have not been able to find the math that allows you to leapfrog ahead and we are kind of making gradual progress one step at a time a new experiment here a new experiment there that gives us new insights and gradually building up but not getting to something yet where were just okay heres an equation that now explains how you know that would be have been two years of experimentation to get there but this tells us what the results going to be unfortunately not so much yet not so much yet but your hope is there in trying to teach robots or systems to do everyday tasks or even in simulation what do you think youre more excited about imitation learning or self play so letting robots learn from humans or letting robots plan their own to try to figure out in their own way and eventually play eventually interact with humans or solve whatever the problem is whats the more exciting to you whats more promising you think as a research direction so when we look at self play whats so beautiful about it is goes back to kind of the challenges in reinforcement learning so the challenge of reinforcement learning is getting signal and if you dont never succeed you dont get any signal in self play youre on both sides so one of you succeeds and the beauty is also one of you fails and so you see the contrast you see the one version of me that did better than the other version so every time you play yourself you get signal and so whenever you can turn something into self play youre in a beautiful situation where you can naturally learn much more quickly than in most other reinforcement learning environments so i think if somehow we can turn more reinforcement learning problems into self play formulations that would go really really far so far self play has been largely around games where there is natural opponents but if we could do self play for other things and lets say i dont know a robot learns to build a house i mean thats a pretty advanced thing to try to do for a robot but maybe it tries to build a hut or something if that can be done through self play it would learn a lot more quickly if somebody can figure that out and i think that would be something where it goes closer to kind of the mathematical leapfrogging where somebody figures out a formalism to say okay any rl problem by playing this and this idea you can turn it into a self play problem where you get signal a lot more easily reality is many problems we dont know how to turn into self play and so either we need to provide detailed reward that doesnt just reward for achieving a goal but rewards for making progress and that becomes time consuming and once youre starting to do that lets say you want a robot to do something you need to give all this detailed reward well why not just give a demonstration because why not just show the robot and now the question is how do you show the robot one way to show is to tally operate the robot and then the robot really experiences things and thats nice because thats really high signal to noise ratio data and weve done a lot of that and you teach your robot skills in just 10 minutes you can teach your robot a new basic skill like okay pick up the bottle place it somewhere else thats a skill no matter where the bottle starts maybe it always goes onto a target or something thats fairly easy to teach your robot with tally up now whats even more interesting if you can now teach your robot through third person learning where the robot watches you do something and doesnt experience it but just kind of watches you it doesnt experience it but just watches it and says okay well if youre showing me that that means i should be doing this and im not gonna be using your hand because i dont get to control your hand but im gonna use my hand i do that mapping and so thats where i think one of the big breakthroughs has happened this year this was led by chelsea finn here its almost like learning a machine translation for demonstrations where you have a human demonstration and the robot learns to translate it into what it means for the robot to do it and that was a meta learning formulation learn from one to get the other and that i think opens up a lot of opportunities to learn a lot more quickly so my focus is on autonomous vehicles do you think this approach of third person watching the autonomous driving is amenable to this kind of approach so for autonomous driving i would say third person is slightly easier and the reason im gonna say its slightly easier to do with third person is because the car dynamics are very well understood so the easier than first person you mean or easier than so i think the distinction between third person and first person is not a very important distinction for autonomous driving theyre very similar because the distinction is really about who turns the steering wheel or maybe let me put it differently how to get from a point where you are now to a point lets say a couple meters in front of you and thats a problem thats very well understood and thats the only distinction between third and first person there whereas with the robot manipulation interaction forces are very complex and its still a very different thing for autonomous driving i think there is still the question imitation versus rl so imitation gives you a lot more signal i think where imitation is lacking and needs some extra machinery is it doesnt in its normal format doesnt think about goals or objectives and of course there are versions of imitation learning and versus reinforcement learning type imitation learning which also thinks about goals i think then were getting much closer but i think its very hard to think of a fully reactive car generalizing well if it really doesnt have a notion of objectives to generalize well to the kind of general that you would want youd want more than just that reactivity that you get from just behavioral cloning slash supervised learning so a lot of the work whether its self play or even imitation learning would benefit significantly from simulation from effective simulation and youre doing a lot of stuff in the physical world and in simulation do you have hope for greater and greater power of simulation being boundless eventually to where most of what we need to operate in the physical world could be simulated to a degree thats directly transferable to the physical world or are we still very far away from that so i think we could even rephrase that question in some sense please and so the power of simulation right as simulators get better and better of course becomes stronger and we can learn more in simulation but theres also another version which is where you say the simulator doesnt even have to be that precise as long as its somewhat representative and instead of trying to get one simulator that is sufficiently precise to learn in and transfer really well to the real world im gonna build many simulators ensemble of simulators ensemble of simulators not any single one of them is sufficiently representative of the real world such that it would work if you train in there but if you train in all of them then there is something thats good in all of them the real world will just be another one of them thats not identical to any one of them but just another one of them another sample from the distribution of simulators exactly we do live in a simulation so this is just one other one im not sure about that but yeah its definitely a very advanced simulator if it is yeah its a pretty good one ive talked to stuart russell its something you think about a little bit too of course youre really trying to build these systems but do you think about the future of ai a lot of people have concern about safety how do you think about ai safety as you build robots that are operating in the physical world what is yeah how do you approach this problem in an engineering kind of way in a systematic way so when a robot is doing things you kind of have a few notions of safety to worry about one is that the robot is physically strong and of course could do a lot of damage same for cars which we can think of as robots too in some way and this could be completely unintentional so it could be not the kind of longterm ai safety concerns that okay ai is smarter than us and now what do we do but it could be just very practical okay this robot if it makes a mistake what are the results going to be of course simulation comes in a lot there to test in simulation its a difficult question and im always wondering like i always wonder lets say you look at lets go back to driving because a lot of people know driving well of course what do we do to test somebody for driving right get a drivers license what do they really do i mean you fill out some tests and then you drive and i mean its suburban california that driving test is just you drive around the block pull over you do a stop sign successfully and then you pull over again and youre pretty much done and youre like okay if a self driving car did that would you trust it that it can drive and id be like no thats not enough for me to trust it but somehow for humans weve figured out that somebody being able to do that is representative of them being able to do a lot of other things and so i think somehow for humans we figured out representative tests of what it means if you can do this what you can really do of course testing humans humans dont wanna be tested at all times self driving cars or robots could be tested more often probably you can have replicas that get tested that are known to be identical because they use the same neural net and so forth but still i feel like we dont have this kind of unit tests or proper tests for robots and i think theres something very interesting to be thought about there especially as you update things your software improves you have a better self driving car suite you update it how do you know its indeed more capable on everything than what you had before that you didnt have any bad things creep into it so i think thats a very interesting direction of research that there is no real solution yet except that somehow for humans we do because we say okay you have a driving test you passed you can go on the road now and humans have accidents every like a million or 10 million miles something pretty phenomenal compared to that short test that is being done so let me ask youve mentioned that andrew ng by example showed you the value of kindness do you think the space of policies good policies for humans and for ai is populated by policies that with kindness or ones that are the opposite exploitation even evil so if you just look at the sea of policies we operate under as human beings or if ai system had to operate in this real world do you think its really easy to find policies that are full of kindness like we naturally fall into them or is it like a very hard optimization problem i mean there is kind of two optimizations happening for humans right so for humans theres kind of the very long term optimization which evolution has done for us and were kind of predisposed to like certain things and thats in some sense what makes our learning easier because i mean we know things like pain and hunger and thirst and the fact that we know about those is not something that we were taught thats kind of innate when were hungry were unhappy when were thirsty were unhappy when we have pain were unhappy and ultimately evolution built that into us to think about those things and so i think there is a notion that it seems somehow humans evolved in general to prefer to get along in some ways but at the same time also to be very territorial and kind of centric to their own tribe like it seems like thats the kind of space we converged onto i mean im not an expert in anthropology but it seems like were very kind of good within our own tribe but need to be taught to be nice to other tribes well if you look at steven pinker he highlights this pretty nicely in better angels of our nature where he talks about violence decreasing over time consistently so whatever tension whatever teams we pick it seems that the long arc of history goes towards us getting along more and more so i hope so so do you think that do you think its possible to teach rl based robots this kind of kindness this kind of ability to interact with humans this kind of policy even to let me ask a fun one do you think its possible to teach rl based robot to love a human being and to inspire that human to love the robot back so to like rl based algorithm that leads to a happy marriage thats an interesting question maybe ill answer it with another question right because i mean but ill come back to it so another question you can have is okay i mean how close does some peoples happiness get from interacting with just a really nice dog like i mean dogs you come home thats what dogs do they greet you theyre excited makes you happy when you come home to your dog youre just like okay this is exciting theyre always happy when im here and if they dont greet you cause maybe whatever your partner took them on a trip or something you might not be nearly as happy when you get home right and so the kind of it seems like the level of reasoning a dog has is pretty sophisticated but then its still not yet at the level of human reasoning and so it seems like we dont even need to achieve human level reasoning to get like very strong affection with humans and so my thinking is why not right why couldnt with an ai couldnt we achieve the kind of level of affection that humans feel among each other or with friendly animals and so forth so question is it a good thing for us or not thats another thing right because i mean but i dont see why not why not yeah so elon musk says love is the answer maybe he should say love is the objective function and then rl is the answer right well maybe oh peter thank you so much i dont want to take up more of your time thank you so much for talking today well thanks for coming by great to have you visit']\n"

hedge corrupting nature centralized power lex friedman podcast support please check sponsors description dear friends heres brian armstrong lets start fact youre programmer first program youve ever written first one remember first memory programming probably middle school remember recess time period could read books kids reading comic books stuff reason gotten idea wanted get computers playing computers home got book think library called learn java 30 days reading book recess didnt understand anything remember went home tried get thing working youve ever written java program first lines public static void main string args whatever foreign difficult get started kind frustrated like dont understand anything thats happening book first thing wrote probably hello world app java felt like confused actually happening later learned bit php php like fun like oh print want didnt complexity around got php started building like simple websites think learned html think introduction programming least beginning part yeah know java lot hello worlds could possibly write java one think longest yeah quite interesting java often least long time used primary programming language teach people program least object oriented programming think universities switched high school switched python im sure thats case probably better easier learn lowers makes less scary like less hurdle certainly none use php love php feel like dirty secret keep private like somebody im seeing side something like respected programming language think theres many ways write poor code php respected yeah scripting language although course facebook built like huge stack top invaluable company still love ruby day ruby probably favorite language pythons great love idea behind ruby like lets make easier human harder computer make joy expressive things never best computer scientist good hacker could rapidly prototype products using languages like ruby lot computer science programs still use like lisp scheme things like thats like thats youre hardcore youre legit youre gonna functional languages think theres others popped lisp distant memory lot people thats like somebody like go library dust book scheme little bit think youre starting mean theres courses languages like programming languages lisp might one know theres languages nobody uses anymore like ancient languages might go school way programming languages back day used use parentheses course still use emacs editor things emacs lot customization lisp thats language probably first really fell love programming lisp long time throughout earlier history artificial intelligence lisp primary language still life 90s aughts people would use beautiful functional language somehow didnt pick said say sort push back php feel like still true web runs php backend still php look know like stuff people dont talk like runs systems world runs backend runs front end javascript know html stack exchange surveys show javascript popular language world think right oh yeah terms programmers numbers wonder survey number programmers stack overflow oh yeah thats also cutting edge right people like excitedly writing code wonder theres people like maintaining gigantic code bases yeah feel like amount java running industrial systems gotta enormous course banking industry finance like even older stuff cobalt whatnot ive actually looking somebody interview represents cobalt fortran like whos figure still holds flag know java founder java creator java creator python creator c nobody wants hold flag cobalt fortran even though important systems world still run like power systems infrastructure systems fascinating atms stuff like like lot stuff rely works reason dont change works well written languages people dont use anymore yeah thatd cool series interviews get stuff thats like tech invented 40 50 years ago still used widely mean emacs example let ask big question cryptocurrency exchanges whats coinbase work ill ask even bigger questions nice kind palate cleansing question coinbase coinbase cryptocurrency exchange brokerage custodian basically primary financial account people crypto economy buy crypto store use increasingly different ways talk yeah want way billion people hopefully access open financial system globally work whats cryptocurrency theres bitcoin theres ethereum mean exchange mean store mean transact coinbase actually okay basically given market theres people want buy people want sell keep order book prices someones willing buy lowest price someones willing sell get trade execute thats kind exchange works underneath brokerage kind simpler even dont know look whole order book everything go say want buy hundred dollars bitcoin whatever cryptocurrency get quote like hit accept core things make kind work make seamless sounds simple surface payment integrations variety places around world make easy people get fiat currency ecosystem work cybersecurity lot theres lots hackers trying break systems steal crypto put stolen credit cards bank accounts things like systems integrate blockchains periodically getting updated various airdrops kinds things integrated lots different blockchains store crypto people buy securely well crypto kind like storing store private keys essentially weve invented lot cool technology securely helps sleep night one largest crypto custodians pieces come together get early simple buy sell experience work yeah mean coinbase actually lot different products like institutional product coinbase commerce like merchant payments like stripe crypto weve got self custodial wallet talk theres kinds cool applications people building web3 access launched nft product go list sort like portfolio crypto products big enough multiple things yeah core thing got started still majority revenue today people wanna come buy sell crypto help make simple easy use ill ask wallet nft called stripe type coinbase commerce coinbase commerce ill ask order books exchange whats difference stocks example theres also order books yes mean stocks trade order books commodities theres similar type situation wanna buy one bitcoin see coinbase say price bitcoin say 40000 press buy happens yeah okay youve gotten lot press button keyboard like electrical signal goes wire keyboard wont cut level thats also important timing right cause price fixed yeah thats true giving quote right theres whole concept like slippage like time quote executed price moved much like may reject theres various things like mean whats simple version give well basically check order book give quote good period time amount slippage whats happening initiating debit payment method whether thats credit card bank account youre storing dollars euros something platform theres various payment methods basically debiting crediting crypto taking fee thats fundamentally whats happening underneath theres interesting slippage calculate much slippage allowed like know things cause order books fascinating dynamics pretty interesting little know yeah theres lot people like traders get super like high frequency traders arbitrage kinds interesting topics flash boys like interesting book whole thing want like access information fastest sometimes even putting thing data center right next thing dont allow colo stuff cause want democratized basically give lets say wanted keep math simple want charge 1 fee youre buying 100 bitcoin well charge 101 weve presented amount bitcoin youre going get 100 lets say 10 seconds later hit accept go fill order going error bound around 1 fee right think actually losing money trade think well often reject part fee slippage incorporated averaged large number people fascinating cause like even like little detail probably requires lot experimentation yeah kind like giant bug bounty get wrong theres people going arbitrage weve people sort pen test systems really creative ways like theyll fire like programmatically apis theyll fire like million different quotes look one thats bounds actually take money right get people kinds crazy stuff protect protect well talk cybersecurity interesting ways theres lot clever people trying clever things earn even break system earn edge kind system stay one step ahead theres silver bullet bunch lead bullets right like know one thing good test suites right youre testing every piece code goes thats like common good best practice particularly important financial services another thing hire third party firms try audit stuff break another one bug bounty program basically pay white hat hackers find stuff black hats weve paid lots good bug bounties know try occasionally dont get right lose money fix keep going yeah lets talk cybersecurity little bit mentioned using stolen bank accounts thats another one thats another interesting one protect okay fraud prevention yeah big topic one theres lot things people one things use machine learning right look hundreds protect attack protect want kind build labeled data set different people turned fraudulent good actors hopefully collect much data know might feed hundreds thousands factors machine learning model itll come back risk score know example like kinds factors people create put know obviously dont want disclose many cat mouse game kind dont know relatively well known stuff might know device fingerprints right like kind device fonts installed lot people farming lots accounts theyre using emulators like virtual machines stuff theyre like know average person device youll see sometimes like one favorite metrics track called like improbable travel velocity would tracking peoples ips right might see someone one day austin texas like hour later london something like well thats improbable mean sometimes people using vpns gotta careful like theres legitimate people use vpns possible gotten plane gotten quickly thats usually theyre like spoofing device ip sometimes interesting factors yeah feed enough oh another fun one like know real users type credit card like one number time scammers list theyll paste whole number look like number milliseconds keystrokes like theres kinds stuff people come even travel velocity could probably incorporate vpns theres probably travel velocity vpn switching thats human like like youre using legitimately vpn something else might theres like legitimate uses actually know feel embarrassed dont know probably im robot capture thing capture thing yeah probably works way like move mouse maybe dynamics clicking totally even work well cant fake need look cause trivial capture feels like crackable yet lot high security places use yeah really interesting another cat mouse game think theyve yeah using lot similar signals like mouse movements keystrokes obviously stuff comes wire browser like operating system fonts headers sent theres actually theres old website cant remember called kind like panoptik click panopticon something basically like proof concept site would show data kind getting sent request like say theres one person world exact set data almost like workaround clever workaround track somebody make identify unique person even like wasnt cookie involved something yeah fascinating world cant see anybody dark yet lot signal figure whos real person whos whos robot whos let step back gonna jump around place let step back thats like interviews get like technical topics lets use bitcoin measure time started coinbase bitcoin 10 mentioned incredible system security transactions everything thought theres lot going version one back early days first prototype coinbase look like like take write think make work enough least make believe gonna work well definitely didnt know gonna work mean kind felt like following gut mean working airbnb software engineer project manager working fraud prevention stuff instance read bitcoin white paper kind december 2010 started going bitcoin meetups bay area bitcoin kind like new reserve currency also stable coins right new inventions yeah basically feel like crypto secret hiding plain sight create economic freedom people world fair free global economy well limit way didnt know argentina whyd end argentina okay basically living houston texas college went school never studied abroad kind like dont know felt like needed adventure something life like running startup trying time tutoring company could work anywhere plan know im gonna go like month every city around south america like almost like force comfort zone never traveled foreign country whatever didnt really speak language anyway landed buenos aires thinking id go around south america never basically set buenos aires apartment cell phone stuff like dont wanna next month stayed time took day trips yeah kind formative experience regard got chance sort unexpectedly experience social effects hyperinflation interesting also ive never really really wanna go person likes tangos person likes argentinian national team soccer steak right things argentina known okay economic freedom one limits economic freedom comes government government regulations kinds things throughout world cryptocurrency help resist sort elaborate little bit things limit economic freedom crypto help ease today world like traditional financial system basically every country world part currency theres group people institutions countries thats controlling economic policy money supply manipulated right like many currencies linked gold standard us kind famously came 1970s instance read ray dalio stuff like talks theres thousands fiat currencies existence time basically eventually get disconnected backing like hard commodities get overinflated printed times stress nixon guess like us vietnam war something like kind drove government spending times stress say hey temporary measure need break peg temporary like famous words used go print bad thing course sort erodes peoples like wealth hold assets cash basically like poor people tend youre wealthy hold stocks like real estate things like really tax poorest people society inflation anyway crypto way little bit like return gold standard digital era right bitcoin theres guaranteed scarcity deflationary theres never gonna 21 million bitcoin thats really important principle also think bitcoin like cryptocurrency generally really important terms asked regulation right think like wanted make global borrowing lending marketplace global exchange would go 200 countries world sometimes like maybe 50 states us get lending licenses operating exchange whatever thats incredible amount work cant even business many countries like bribe somebody corrupt whatever defi decentralized finance people published like uniswap decentralized exchange everybody world matter country youre jurisdiction interface decentralized exchange theres central company operating smart contract ethereum blockchain globally decentralized theres throat choke theres one person company go like hey shut thing even everybody whos working uniswap today stopped uniswap smart contract would continue operate ethereum blockchain similarly like borrowing lending marketplace like somebody india wants borrow somebody us whatever theres difficult traditional financial world smart contract thats decentralized enable anybody access really kind great democratizing force creating new financial system fair free yeah ways clever way thats enabling people novel way uniswap sense competitive coinbase way way people dont know coinbase centralized let ask doesnt go spirit crypto since crypto decentralized pros cons centralized exchange dont think coinbase fully centralized many different products way think exchange brokerage centralized regulated financial service business actually important crypto ecosystem wanna allow lot fiat money world flow crypto economy proud think weve helped lot money flow people money crypto choose hold variety ways choose hold self custodial wallet decentralized choose use decentralized exchanges love uniswap really dont think like direct competitor us basically integrated uniswap number products love defi decentralized exchanges whole thing coinbase wallet self custodial wallet decentralized allows people hold crypto dont trust us explain self custodial wallet wallet self custodial wallet yeah confusing custodial wallet means youre trusting coinbase store crypto private keys people institutions everything meeting today thats nice simpler theyre afraid losing crypto make accidental mistake custodial crypto products important help get bunch people ecosystem im supportive self custodial wallets think ways future people gonna want store crypto trust third party institution ways much authentic ethos crypto coinbase help convert fiat crypto frankly thats centralized thing crypto go self custodial world store get technical details second basically saying youre gonna store keys device even coinbase gets court order seize actually cant architecture point view cant coinbase gets hacked something cant lose funds thing take responsibility taking individual person could get hacked theres whole bunch really cool research happening make self custodial wallets resilient accidental loss hacks user error dont know much youve looked various cryptography things basically multiple signatures different keys different devices need two three three five theres whole technology called multi party computation threshold signing signatures really cool things would run locally security measures cryptography measures protect without centralized component right simple example would lets say two three key signature one key might stored coinbase thats quorum couldnt unilaterally move funds another key device phone lets say oh cool normal situation key phone one two three get signed quickly day day use lets say lose phone something third key thats could store backup somewhere like google drive icloud could trust third party thats coinbase also one key cant anything unilaterally one key thats simple example get way complicated yeah thats awesome idea funds get seized coinbase cant anything better lose phone maybe case yeah yeah provides even lose phone recovery mechanism get one key coinbase one backup provider recover new one back phone know yeah coinbase longer government say north korea government says youre longer like coinbase shut country something like get even access two perhaps silly question isnt self custodial wallet competitor notion coinbase mean offer self custodial wallet weve built one like one doesnt bleed like guess im asking sort financial question like coinbase make money transactions decrease number significantly negatively affect transactions focused growing number pie number people using cryptocurrency yeah like traditional financial service firm would probably say well storing lets keep custody us thats prove world valuable whatever dont really believe like think actually kind want encourage users move self custody time ready willing technology needs mature im trying like force anybody doesnt want thats like future get billions people using crypto doesnt mean go somewhere else easier yeah thats sort point like using protocol theres low switching costs keeps companies accountable right like want access visa network theres one company world go like visa want access bitcoin network theres dozens hundreds companies arguably could argue worse us company think better makes bitcoin interesting cryptocurrency interesting nobody controls low switching costs customers better customers means companies space going held high standard minute lose someones trust theyre going move bitcoin service thats good world think coinbase theres ideas layer one layer two layer three technologies think coinbase layer one layer two layer three said theres many products coinbase umbrella hard answer question think acknowledge existence layer three know usually people using terms layer one layer two theyre referring like layer one would blockchain layer one blockchain like bitcoin ethereum something like centralized service like coinbase even decentralized self custodial wallet yeah wouldnt consider us like layer one decentralized protocols integrating coinbase yes layer two thing basically transactions without settlement blockchain get benefits faster transactions without security associated blockchain layer three suppose sort apps built top know least think talking michael saylor considers coinbase layer three technology interesting okay im really particularly familiar kind distinction layer three two dont see fundamentally different okay mean one way asking layer two like magic happening order make transactions associated blockchain happen instant theyre quick coinbase coinbase yeah magic going youre okay say many cryptocurrencies currently coinbase two yeah lot two yeah understand incorporate technologies yeah make magic sort universal transactions happen across different cryptocurrencies theres centralized products decentralized products right centralized products storing crypto youre moving one accounts another account like eth1 account eth2 account eth coinbase centralized account eth centralized transaction chain make faster saves customer fees confirms instantly truly using decentralized blockchain right also send bitcoin address ethereum address instance putting transaction chain decentralized products like coinbase wallet self custodial wallet every transaction happening chain basically shows little bit evolution coinbase blockchains like early days networks scalable l2 solutions instance sort hacks like moving crypto chain moving accounts stuff like otherwise minor fees would eaten us alive company right yeah blockchains starting scale theres whole bunch work needs done getting l2 solutions think transactions going chain whether l2 l1 ideally shouldnt many transactions chain internal coinbase ledger something thats really spirit crypto say chain includes layer two technology blockchain proposes yeah guess asking much fun magic happening chain within coinbase youre saying early days youre trying less less look theres bunch high frequency traders use centralized products even regular retail people dont want pay gas fees stuff theyre trying actually back envelope calculated one point like would completely infeasible like high frequency traders put everything chain point thats basically dexs important think going move decentralized time great basically dexs decentralized exchanges way yeah anyway want encourage move decentralized time dont centralized things arent going away like long time decade theres going big institution pension fund central bank thats like right got hold crypto lets set account centralized way thats thats fine important know number cryptocurrencies currently coinbase know number hundred depends depends jurisdiction youre know institution versus retail theres like theres many different categories hundred yeah take become become asset become cryptocurrency coinbase add technology coinbase okay well trying get away idea listed coinbase seen like endorsement something actually think important considered judge jury know like imagine early days internet like whats good webpage whats bad webpage like would totally wrong anytime big tech companies try make review review boards like know apple famously gets trouble lot app store review process right something think like committee people somewhere thinks looks silly may turn next big thing right difficult basically test legality right check know believe security cant listed coinbase theres rigorous process go currently way laws us cant weve acquired broker duo license sec trying work get operational hopefully someday trade real crypto securities today thats possible us least look sort cybersecurity crypto asset see theres flaw smart contract know way somebody could manipulate without customers permission look compliance pieces well like actors behind like know kind criminal history anything like believe meets listing standards basically test legality everything customer protection want list want market point decide kind like amazon something like know product might three stars might five stars starts get one star consistently like probably fraudulent defective something like maybe amazon remove otherwise want let market decide things thats generally way assets think especially like low market cap assets going traded dexs coinbase dont need list every asset centralized exchange think dexs really good long tail becomes even even clear people like endorsement coinbase like assets good ones bad like know belief theres going millions assets time hope doesnt like make news every time add one future basically yeah wonder get even look coinbase example know people imagine sort tag twitter something like like interview sort founder particular coin right yeah hard know whats first whats interesting technology whats whos scammer whos actually legitimately representing ambitious new thing versus scam know theres sources like verification signal unfortunately coinbase part become little bit youre trying get away youre trying get many sort let people decide youre thinking like amazon star type system people could rate yeah think well actually probably add like user ratings reviews well cautious like know real people theres bunch stuff already think wisdom crowds good terms getting feedback items also gonna review mentioned earlier right like okay meets minimum bar listed site yeah think yeah important know coin scam well see things know hate use word scam lot judgment calls gotta kind court may jury may land either way things would red flags look would know bunch asset owned insider insiders short vesting periods know background founders like may criminal records theyve perpetrated frauds past right theres difference something product like doesnt anything interesting something thats actual fraud outright scam lot data whats cool available chain look like tokenomics behind see owns selling know like inappropriately pumping like youtube twitter making promises hey value thing may higher future like big big nos would know dont wanna go whole thing like want enable innovation space allow anybody curtail advancement industry like kind fraudulent thing get rich quick thing tricky industry im trying figure know whats interesting understand research hard know let ask tricky one add centralized exchange privacy preserving cryptocurrency like monero yeah technically difficult like monero example forget specific one like privacy preserving cryptocurrency blockchains ever possible add thats great question answer maybe heres reason regulated financial service business various licenses regulated various regulators part licenses requires us quote reasonable program monitor suspicious activity know aml program anti money laundering right coin hundred percent anonymous cant really blockchain analytics track source funds things might going makes harder reasonable program around thats defensible privacy preserving coins like zcash something called view key view key basically another key allows deanonymize transactions specific situations want instance know support zcash one ways got comfortable youre buying coinbase know basically view key transactions anonymous youre buying see goes afterwards whole standard program gets hops away road mean people could eventually turn privacy preserving aspects know tough judgment calls least terms interaction customer everything feel comfortable think theres broader point actually think privacy coins good thing world allowed like know despite weve made judgment call operate regulated safe compliant way taking coinbase hat minute think world would better place privacy coins kind like internet first came online like https everything http know people afraid put credit cards internet messages could intercepted stuff whole internet basically moved https little lock icon browser better like financial information like important information keep private right theres times like lets say youre running charity something want total auditability transparency whole world donated money go thats great want public like personal money something like dont want broadcasting whole world ways thats blockchains know pseudonymously like public ledger know owns address basically deanonymize know think basically people fight privacy freedoms kinds privacy money good thing would like see future chosen coinbase seat table regulators kind conversations table regulations like level understanding regulators worried thinking positive negative regulations youre facing youre educating struggling pushing back supporting kind stuff yeah oh man theres many cause mean live like know maybe hundred countries point conversations map im trying think broad strokes could paint id say one trend thats positive basically regulators around world last five years would say common find regulator today asking preserve innovation potential technology keeping bad actors five years ago saying bad activity prevent maybe say fraction ill give like us specific example although operate many countries go dc would say know 50 60 people meet basically know theyre camp crypto lot potential regulate make sure bad people dont something bad stay lot upside basically create awful regulation celebrate actually encourage innovation happen us thats huge change three years ago probably 30 people saying like 60 like almost double getting harder find like true crypto skeptics dc id say know maybe like 20 30 people like willing say something negative like actually think net negative like really hard defend position point almost like one five americans used tried crypto point youre kind condemning 20 fellow citizens say point know especially nfts things like huge segment people dont even care investing whatever came space basically thats conversation happening know delayed years like india europe asian countries countries really embraced crypto theyre like trying really theyre ahead us theyre trying actually attract best startups entrepreneurs like know like dubai uk australia kind pushing good regulation el salvador actually guess adopted like bitcoin legal tender another country central african republic think supposedly well know theres countries like china autocratic saying hey threat power like gonna try really curtail kind regulations feel limiting empowering like specific examples yeah okay mean basically think securities laws us need clarified crypto many different things thats people dont realize like crypto like bitcoin ethereum many others probably like commodities theyre controlled one person know like anyway theres people wanna raise money company thats sounds like security regulated sec commodities regulated cftc theres cryptocurrencies like currencies like stable coins central bank digital currencies probably know regulated treasury someone like theres whole another category cryptocurrencies none things theyre nfts like artwork theyre metaverse items decentralized identity voting think theres unhelpful point view folks hey like bad activity need shut gonna pursue enforcement actions something like people dc dont feel way anymore think people us dont feel way anymore lot using stuff general view theres lot upside potential agree lets get rid fraud scams wanna get rid lets create relatively simple test says like nobody controls 20 threshold probably like commodity someones raising money theyre selling thing business probably security like medium exchange currency none things maybe artwork whatever legal test like would help clarify regulator regulating also wanna probably like sandbox innovation youre startup youre less dont know number less amount payment volume customer funds youre storing like let things get ground without soul crushing amount legal bills uncertainty us get would great think bunch countries rushing around world sort create regulation attract innovation international bodies like imf g20 stuff theyre starting look proposed regulation hope coinbase bunch crypto companies help conversation whole policy effort think actually crypto policy efforts like probably one biggest things dc right moves slow speed government yeah meantime trying help people use crypto ultimately thats democracies thats care like theyll people country want want governments start understanding differences crypto space commodities securities currencies nfts still dont understand supposed make sense nfts nfts exactly perspective regulator yeah categories yeah nfts could think like artwork although knows gonna go could mentioned metaverse right mentioned kind unique identity thing yeah like theres people selling virtual land nfts actually bought nft thats like like citizenship like city dow wyoming like ive never almost like badge attestation like get access location theres like people like tickets events like know theyre called poaps like proof attendance things like itll interesting see nfts go time could get thats danger dont wanna try like define regulation dont even know things gonna go efforts policy arm education yeah education advocacy trying like helpful educational resource essentially give us feedback theyre like hey dont dont like happy anything thats requested generally go get licenses weve tried right thing absence clarity clear law says basically good things think may required future show good faith effort towards right thing thats part like innovating regulated field know whole topic table let less case united states government agencies seize persons cryptocurrency forcing coinbase hand youre centralized phone number call okay complicated topic like really wanna sure people wanna store crypto right like self custodial wallets like coinbase wallet embracing decentralization wanna avoid us rule law right reasonable protections place around like search seizure things like know coinbase publish transparency reports get subpoenas court orders things like various countries around world situations ordered freeze accounts things like know follow law another way put regulated financial service business money used part breaking law thats particular jurisdiction particular right thing sometimes actually get court orders subpoenas overly broad weve seen need follow due process right weve seen past like well need freeze huge number accounts like well well actually gone court like pushed back said like probable cause threshold met like weve cases behalf customers yeah actually really kind unfortunate frustrating large business spend lot resources basically interacting inbound requests kinds lawyers people requesting things silly ridiculous push back say kind tax every company certain size ultimately gets passed customer higher fees employ armies lawyers deal stuff educate something much innovation legal space lawyers working coinbase new cutting edge thing youre theres lot gray area youre supposed operating like hard lawyer coinbase like much precedence guess im asking mean like said three years kind new space yeah well probably hard lawyer coinbase fun whenever youre new field thats growing fast isnt lot case law precedent set thats also opportunity go create stuff thats lot legal careers made like take complex situation balance difficult things like prevent bad activity still enable innovation thats hard question theres go draft legislation circulate policymakers come policies operate business environment law unclear right like try right thing like strike right balance yeah lot lawyers come creative stuff mentioned one things youre focused expanding number people maybe billion people coinbase using cryptocurrency get billion q4 last year 89 million verified accounts coinbase given quarter maybe like 10 little million like really active look globally think estimates ive seen maybe theres like 200 million people something like ever used tried crypto long know ways billion like far get get billion things one blockchains got become way scalable kind like running dial modems need broadband like expensive slow transactions think get l2s working scalability know well see another order magnitude kind come think second one would clear regulation would help lot talk know pension funds know various asset managers sovereign wealth funds stuff lot tell weve got 1 portfolio crypto today really would rather like 20 waiting clear regulation coming saying clear test saying assets commodities regulated scpc scc treasury whatever would big unlock transactions one things mentioned payments sorry yeah well unlock lot users yeah mean remittance like huge thing people sending money home families countries fees super high yeah get blockchains scalable theres global adoption like think well see remittance quarters move crypto lot theres also thing thats driving lot crypto adoption basically creation third party apps dapps theyre sometimes called decentralized dapps lot startups know like used use early 2000s called themcom startups dont need saycom cause everybodys using internet theres like hundreds thousands crypto startups think future wont need call crypto startups cause theyll called startups cause everyones using internet crypto whatever anyway use cases utility crypto getting better better like third party apps getting funded created think theres going killer set killer dapps like thing nobody live without still waiting theres going bunch like like internet like killer web companies know like uber wikipedia airbnb google like theres going big winners therell thousands basically new like happened thecom startups early 2000s like lot best entrepreneurs building crypto startups tons venture money flowing space lot smart young people think bitcoin cryptocurrency become reserve currency world point cause kind controversial idea actually think yes think bitcoin could end becoming reserve currency world ive reading ray dalio recently new book like changing world order thought really well researched book talks looks back history right looks like empires going back various chinese empires dutch ottomans everybody rise able reserve currency rose produced like came good education innovation better trade anyway us measures kind looks like maybe really good run coming little bit china kind coming knows thatll play way like world complicated could could switch guess us dollar gonna seeing inflation future chinese yuan like necessarily better right mean ton debt well like could really yuan could inflated well right probably think theres group people today probably traditional dont know like people run big banks like governments stuff theyre really radar today think theres basically group younger people kind 25 35 year old range tech savvy theyre starting think crypto like primary thing financial life like basically hold wealth crypto use dollars euros whatever happen need something convert last minute like im traveling might convert local currency moment thats hold wealth segment population like massive yet gdp point view think leading indicator things could going actually good world kind like especially china continue rise authoritarian view itll kind centralized east versus decentralized west people west free world really kind embracing crypto open fair free global financial system think enormously beneficial humanity think basically bitcoin reserve currency gold standard crypto economy thats pretty crazy yeah gold standard mean also like ray dalio feel like china drive lot either response directly mean think ruble im paying close attention financial systems think theyre trying tie gold thats interesting maybe itll one authoritarian regime switch bitcoin standard first west pressure catch versus way around fascinating think forcing function kind perturbation required switch change anything honestly financial system could youre saying waiting people young embracing crypto enter positions power essentially hope thats case innovation wait sorry say older folk pass away thats efficient way make change yeah thats super interesting topic peoples minds become less plastic age guess feature called wisdom also need wild ones explore exploration versus exploitation wrote blog post thats really interesting september 2020 titled coinbase mission focused company like talking one interesting thing said blog post going distracted activism within company thats related mission company thats rare thing company state company ceo state especially climate first describe little detail meant receive blowback definitely received blowback yeah ill describe meant want talk came talk meant theres lot companies right including tech companies exclusively think like great companies important mission theyre trying something really good world unfortunately theyre getting little distracted times employee activism causing company basically jump whatever current thing try help like positive interpretation negative interpretation would virtue signal view actually kind destructive largely american company phenomenon way worry making america less competitive even though think kind internationally minded us citizen whole life put statement employees us confused like brian need say saying youre going focus work work thats already certain pockets us certain cities particular employees peculiar cultural phenomenon evolved think people really wanted company worked almost acting like government something like trying solve hardest societal issues least opinion contribute solution almost everything uncomfortable situation ceo id never quite situation time employees past kind asking questions would asking like make product better like competitor regulator got place around time questions receiving think even things related company broader societal issues like brian whats stance xyz controversial thing often like didnt opinion really hard questions right didnt really felt like distracting company people internally getting fights lot like disagreeing thing like social slack internally turning social media almost people putting flame wars culminated way walkout happened company received like demands employee groups various things like basically antagonistic thing management employee like team wanna antagonistic lets somebody else outside company trying improve world dimension yeah eventually like okay company aligned dont feel dont like job ceo frankly like job come every day like squirm front like difficult societal questions dont think wanna job like either theyre gonna go im gonna go founded company really believe mission theyre gonna go realized basically made exit package available anybody wasnt board direction 5 employees took got company realigned towards mission work way people go anything like political social activism outside work totally fine like everybody stuff like personal life work also disagree work way work know like disagreement culture like lets try get truth dont bring stuff work thats gonna create division make workplace refuge division crazy things like aligned work mission lets yeah really really really refreshing hear speaking theres sense companies take issues publicly ceo position anywhere else seem optimize virtue signaling versus solving particular problem solve particular problem really really put huge hire huge number basically create company company take particular thing allow internally care particular issue youre basically pacifying number employee like making sure slack doesnt get hand youre kind perspective especially issues care fake virtue signaling basically trying understand make look best would make company look best particular aspect seems shallow optimizing wrong thing solving problems making look like good guy trying leverage say im good guy situations wrong thing perhaps perspective ceo leader also creating division unnecessary division within people like get yeah theres something us gets extremely argumentative certain topics really bring emotion think probably saying emotion even probably okay maybe productive emotion mission company like really care disagreements versus like something nothing increasing economic freedom using crypto yeah fascinating refreshing rare think thats rare city youre mentioning mean theres bunch cities san francisco one city culture sad san francisco also bay area also hub historically greatest innovation human history theres tension culture emerge like innovation done people mission driven get bunch smart people together solve difficult problem get maybe sometimes much blinders try balance requires focus solve actual problem yet thats also place culture emerged fascinating human dynamic dont know somebody one day tell history silicon valley innovation social dynamics occurred anyway think thats rare well people dont wanna get attacked like super dont wanna get canceled right super uncomfortable nobody wants called racist whatever people wanna say twitter get attacked yeah yeah definitely got attacked mean knew would controversial reason frankly kind wits end like well like said earlier like job ceo job sucks like either dont wanna go im gonna make company something want id spent eight 90 years life point kind building thing like well could go start another company takes long time get momentum things coinbase rare thing happened world feel passionate yeah im gonna go like need make company wanna work really interesting huge outpouring support knew would controversial would get attacked predictably journalists new york times people kind like went started writing hit pieces company shortly thereafter basically call people whove left company get quotes whatever want theyll write story mainstream media lost lot trust mainstream media frankly course kind become obvious since mainstream media like hyper politicized point basically either super left super right really focused truth thats kind unfortunate think journalism actually like really important society whole thing got eroded us luckily theres sort new media people like whole bunch people blog post help statement 95 people remained still something struggle also culture broader tech space okay interesting thing 95 people stayed got huge outpouring support people said thank god finally spoke said something frankly making fun place work either realized think think nassim taleb blog post tyranny 1 something like theres basically relatively small group one 5 something like really upset something majority company like 5 theres another 15 something sympathetic cause theyre actually somewhat suggestible go along whatever sounds reasonable like real issues theyre talking say real theyll kind get swept theres 80 company basically doesnt agree wants get work done without drama distraction theyre afraid speak speak theyre afraid called racist like fired ostracized amongst peers require get bad enough place finally say know feel like live short term attacks press ultimately freeing dont really care actually build company want build without caring cool lot really great people reached coinbase like im early engineer google wherever culture gotten kind messed want work company thats willing stand weve gotten lot good people come basically realized way diversity numbers stuff people told drafting poster dont post people underrepresented groups never want work company like dont think thats true talked erg groups theyre telling care stuff much theyre telling want respected work good work contribute gut telling advice wrong tell year diversity numbers basically either better every category turned false look hate polarizing either dimension want get good work done build good stuff technology think companies reasonable policies want get rid bias hiring want attract great people different backgrounds pledge 1 put 1 company equity foundation hope able good stuff lets give back way main message guess core mission core work economic freedom products main value contributing world lets hopefully get 89 million verified users billion whatever think thats well biggest impact tempting though interesting companies get tempted help step almost like drug cant forget mean like us life companies get distracted maintaining focus youre absolutely right way coinbase add value world maximize mission stuff get wealthier successful becomes tempting help shallow ways fascinating kind brought light refreshing shouldnt controversial sort focus getting stuff done well let ask mean think things tie together theres like general trend like censorship theres like cancel culture theres like freedom values kind even like freezing peoples accounts like trucker thing happened seems like theres general trend authoritarian policies feel like tide turning like theres counter examples weve seen recently think last gasp old way things theres desperation fair kind internet wheres source lot people voice making power centers world really nervous thats thats coming think internet tricky weird full bots full like misinformation kinds full large groups conspiracy theories mean misinformation broadly people misusing word misinformation theyre governments labeling random things misinformation censor think like new world met lots interesting people like crazy people anarchists really brilliant people started nights weekends trying put together prototype initial thought well smtp protocol runs email git protocol version control people made like gmail github people dont wanna run email server even git server wanna like use hosted thing security backups thought head time bitcoins new protocol theres probably gonna somebody makes hosted service security backups makes bitcoin protocol easy use maybe make like hosted bitcoin wallet something gonna make gmail bitcoin something bunch people told bad idea like smart friends told like well first dont really get youre like bitcoin sounds like scam something youve gotten involved people understood bitcoin told thought dumb idea theyre like dude store bitcoin youre gonna get hacked like nobody know would kind thought like know im gonna go like make store everyones bitcoin would much right job day job know let make prototype ill tell people like beta thing like dont put real money see theres interest feel like im onto something maybe ill go company cause really wanted entrepreneur time like 29 almost turning 30 always wanted like start company know wasnt yet employee company great anyway prototype hacking together nights weekends actually wrote whole bitcoin node ruby turned maybe weird decision hindsight cause ruby wasnt performant language weve subsequently rebuild many times yeah hosted bitcoin wallet thing didnt users way applied combinator cause like maybe somebody writes check like make feel like real company trying find co founder time unsuccessfully basically wandering desert lot self doubt cause like dont know friends dont think kind dumb maybe bitcoin gonna get shut like stupid thing definitely feeling wandering lost desert lots self doubt paul graham combinator group kind wrote first check went interviewed stuff wrote check like 150k first time somebody really looked kind said worth pursuing like maybe youre onto something maybe youre like lets least try kind gave confidence quit job try ill wrap story saying like found right co founder combinator still didnt customers thing basically launched hosted bitcoin wallet people signing posted reddit places like maybe like hundred people would sign nobody would come back like combinator often tell like talk customers improve product talk customers improve product thats youre supposed try find product market fit emailed like five users signed like hey worked app saw signed get phone get phone like five folks like didnt come back guy like well app okay beta like dont bitcoins didnt really know remember light bulb kind went head like well put buy bitcoin button would used like yeah maybe went process co founder time like got basically get like bank partnership payment rails know exchange basic exchange functionality stuff mentioning earlier place minute launched feature could click buy put bank counter credit card buy bitcoin showed account day forward like number users started go like finally found product market fit two years wandering desert werent even thinking buy ramps would think would wallet place store bitcoin youve already gotten yeah okay mean cause thats pain work others convert dollars fiat currency bitcoin yeah mean overwhelmed immensity task sort allowing think deeply whole thing letting optimism take know really looking forward like something crazy like big challenge wanted love kind crisis moments like know im determined right especially get like set something im like know im gonna figure way make fucking thing work like matter reveled sort read books startups like every startup like know major setbacks like nothing works sign youre something right idea anything right like kind loving experience weird way felt felt stressful time like know nothing working felt like right path somehow kept going dont know darkest moment youve gone mind time tougher moments said self doubt yeah yeah whered go whered go mind moment youre like laying hopeless well theres couple moments im remembering mean whatever reason like big chip shoulder time like really want something important world like know could good life like work good companies write software im reason never wanted probably would healthier honestly like expected value outcome thats probably better thing life like like man really want something important bigger impact like willing sacrifice lot like sleep going friends stuff remember one like years working stuff remember one darker moments probably like maybe five employees time remember like bunch bad things happened like first remember time sleep deprived kind exacerbates everything look like exxon valdez spill like natural disasters like sleep deprivation often involved reason sleep deprived working much like site would go offline middle night wed get id get paged like pager duty id get woken sometimes like two three times night like try fix something go back sleep environment kind get get discouraged one bad thing happened bug website thousands people reddit twitter like pissed coinbase like balances showing wrong like fuck company like hate guys id never feeling thousand people mad time know feel like im pretty chill guy like time people dont get mad one another one pause thats interesting saying like heres dream im trying create something forever reputation dream ruined never irrecoverable kind feeling yeah well didnt youre right didnt know time like end like everybody tiny everybody hates us yeah nobody told starting company like youre bunch people hate like counterintuitive thing cause know companies think good things world least youre trying right even someones like trying theyre theyre failing im generally rooting least youre trying right thats case founders ive known gone theyre surprised amount hate get think actually like muscle build tolerance like know go talk somebody whos like feels terrible cause youre center storm like go go talk like know family person like dude didnt even hear like theyre busy life idea negative press like whatever put put link yeah theres interesting person id like bring example bill gates yeah gets large amount hate internet yeah theres something talking seems touch hate believe least understanding resources hes trying actually lot good yet theres gigantic amount hate conspiracy theories stuff like right feels like thats case hes somehow touch people internet really finally taking hold theres billions devices everybody voice almost basically governments powerful people slightly losing hold power theyre starting freak little bit thats young people coming gain power think well rebalance everything theres like said promising signs obvious majority people want freedom means lot things means economic freedom means freedom voice freedom move around freedom act way without reasonable sort limitations people dont best interests gain hope regular people fighting like demanding able freedom speech specifically sort resisting crude overreach government acts censorship least united states hopefully percolates rest world thats struggling much basic level people put prison words say banned twitter right could worse lessons failures successes takes run company think one things learned leadership never really thought natural leader honest dont think natural leader always envisioned good leaders like military generals like seem confident theyre like bark orders charge hill actually like introverted kind wasnt really confident way communicated realized theres lots different kinds leaders kind ceo want right kind like product technical focus ceo preferred sort hear everyones opinion wasnt gonna like render decision room like kind heated moment like piss half people would like right im gonna go think ill send decision later today tomorrow whatever found ways kind make work could basically always tried avoid like people getting like super emotional something like think theyre thinking judgment goes right like never make decision youre angry right would always sort try get sense people like trying right trying seek truth little tricks like okay argue persons position argue one like see genuinely represent know youre listening kinds things guess sorry getting back question leadership think basically kept things little outside comfort zone comfort zone kept getting bigger bigger know think thats build confidence thing thats scary like little outside like first started coinbase never managed anybody would scared death put like controversial opinion like sort right 5 people go didnt know percent gonna way could 1 could 50 like went scary scary thing like dont know think right im gonna enough scary things like youll build confidence feel like im still journey every year two coinbase theres big thing comes like oh god like didnt sleep well week like next level right thats learn grow youre still going mountain fog one step time yeah quickly ask couple efforts super interesting youre involved first little bit old school fascinating effort research hub whats github open science yeah okay basically ive chance try help couple companies get ground cause wanna see various efforts succeed one ive always thought like scientific research like open source software couldnt much faster right theres youve probably seen like academic setting right theres kinds things feel antiquated scientific research everything funding process grants peer review works submit journals costs associated journals know people youd think like youd get paid something would available taxpayers free theyre like theyre pay walled theres like big companies sort view kind held back innovation preprint servers like bioarchive archiveorg really helped websites look like theyre kind like 15 years ago something yeah like craigslist something yeah anyway one things coinbase went public last year little bit liquidity like right let fund small team lets see like go make something better prototype researchhubcom people check basically know first version kind like reddit science theres like various hubs like journals know publish papers use electronic lab notebook sort modern day paper pdf thats static living document ideally future know get comments feedback people update time want people able share code data sets associated paper research paper pdf future want make even like know people get funding science site even license innovations theyve made thing ive noticed life theres kind like theres bunch people working science theres bunch people building companies rarely intersect get best things like spacex genentech even google like even coinbase based research paper bitcoin white paper business people like creating companies dont scientific innovation theyre like marketing based know whatever lot scientists making things never actually benefit humanity theyre commercialized turned products somehow create translation layer two groups help know helps align market forces align scientific research market forces theyre incentivized like discover crispr something like like billionaire know like downstream implications going antiquated tech transfer office whatever youre entrepreneur looking commercialize latest scientific innovations thats kind like longterm vision site think early step today weve got like really passionate community jumping like know computer science longevity various bio hubs whatever like beginning source best innovations also discuss improve publish site question incentives first let say people listening outside academia might familiar absurd situation theres journals like mentioned scientists publishing journals journals provide little value except matching reviewers unpaid digital world theyre providing basically almost value except hosting paper put paywall charge people access charge like even netflix fees youre talking lot money theyre basically blocking research wide open world creating paywall fascinating like scam thats actually holding back dont shitty scam youre making much money feel like definition scam least making money like significant amount money youre basically making shady money holding back human knowledge okay put aside people get little confused journals arent ones paying scientists people think like journals somehow funding scientists therefore right put paywall funding coming elsewhere journals middleman nobody asks especially digital world anyway said interesting kind incentives scientists prestige theres thing journals theres prestigious journal pass review process get journal prestigious conference computer science thats seen good thing resume oh resume within community thats respected thing way achieve kind incentive open setting research hub like could say got x z like look im impressive happened research hub think youre right like whole academia like progress track like got published many citations kind like false economy reputation like theres real money backing think weve thought little bit think research hub team opportunity something basically says like okay top paper 2022 biology basically publish list leaderboards like top month year different categories actually probably give grants awards addition fund people almost like fellows even give like know like nobel prize like research hub prize something like ship people maybe even ship like print version journal top papers category month whatever like people want put wall lab like think need sort change dont know like traditional folks academia science would probably think like crazy idea think need change culture celebrate getting published paywall journals almost like friends dont let friends publish like paywall journals like cause thats helping humanity like know prestigious publish open science way get top spot celebrated published whatever dont even want name one know well theres currently culture already shifted almost everybody publishes archive archive yeah culture scene friends dont let friends publish open prestige thing missing like anyone publish archive know actually strong paper funny enough even crappy systems word mouth powerful like like citation system pretty powerful like say okay strong paper dont need reviewers human eyes reviewers like community reviewers already like part would nice like know nature level like respect respectful accomplishment yeah something like leaderboard stable kind system yeah mention theres crypto angle research hub coin associated research coin basically people know upvote paper like support youll accumulate research coin basically like rep like reward token way guess measure communitys collective view paper form peer review even weighted like reputation people voting sort thing time yeah think last thing ill say think rep like prestige point view wont start way itll probably start like little quirky like know like remember youtube first started like people posting weird cat videos stuff like know million subscribers youtube thats probably better getting like tv show nbc whoever traditional gatekeeper hope might take 10 years 20 years whatever im hoping sort new prestigious way young people publish science itll come viewed prestigious journals traditional journals viewed old fashioned well definitely system could lot better theres lot incredible brilliant people science deserve better better platforms another thing youre taking helping new limit looking longevity whats idea yeah okay see im excited science like think know science sort basically get scientific innovation get better products get better economic growth get kinds like surplus society go arts philosophy like kinds stuff new limits yeah kind got started hosting dinners scientists last year learning kinds latest stuff happening bio theres lot really cool stuff happening like car cells crispr things anyway one topics started learn something called cell reprogramming know people maybe heard induced pluripotent stem cells could take like skin cell turn back stem cell shinya yamanaka nobel prize work done 2006 know kind crazy thing turn one cell another type cell well people recently experimenting different types transcription factors would either dont want cell go way back stem cell end getting like cancerous cells things like want basically cell revert little bit earlier know would call waddington landscape basically like go become act start act like bit younger cell de differentiate become like stem cell decided might interesting area go fund think team come together theres like really talented people whove come together help get ground theyre basically building platform test lot different transcription factors different cell types hopefully find ways rejuvenate different types cells tissues extend human health span mean moonshot goal know get mars could therapy dont know 10 20 years take whole body point view sort rejuvenating tissue one type tissue like immune system eventually whole body maybe even brain know dont issue people older trouble learning theyre ossified thinking always think know actually little inspired elon right like biggest things world like probably high technology risk work maybe theyre kind low chance working work would enormous impact like idea trying hard tech problems especially people like founders like whove made money software think kind like golden age software theres like fortunes made make money hope people like atoms bits know try harder things like biotech know guess hes cars rockets stuff anyway think try hard tech know physical science problems well see advance team human yeah hes also bio neuralink feel like bio tough messy dont understand well dont understand risk higher terms risk higher like deal actual sort get human get stuff could therapies actual human bodies tricky prove safe effective kinds things fda mean tricky difficult long journey mean give quick plug yeah im board new limit hiring talented scientists interested cellular programming space dont necessarily coming like aging background anything like theres sort small group people even new thing new limit relatively new yeah new theres small team today handful people hiring people excited space reach thing research hub theres small team thats really awesome thats like software engineering design product kind stuff advice would give put old wise sage hat advice would give young people today high school maybe undergrad college life like career career proud maybe life proud people whatever want happy right theres one way think people particular type people lot people actually want impact world thats get sense fulfillment right mean need like health physical health need good relationships like theres lots things people want something important want fulfilling work way feel like theyre contributing think lot people young people today thinking like activist something like theres people world power lot people dont dont power way change world speak truth power like criticize power try pressure change dont think thats right way actually impact world everybody probably think people power realize way easy critic hard actually change things fix youll get lot accolades friends things like kind go around criticizing easy like everything broken could better including stuff im working find like frustrating theres million things want better like coinbase person arena like theodore roosevelt quote think said right like go chew glass stare abyss like really want impact either join company mission trying fix thing youre passionate start company doesnt exist start charity suitable company whatever go try part solution dont criticize part problem hope people realize actually meaningful impact way think technology actually one important ways improve world like look climate change like lot best ideas like carbon sequestration things technology thing right want try fix education like look like khan academy stuff going online right want fix know whatever transportation like financial system global freedom like equality things like theres typically way get something changed world today technology think people bizarre theres kind like anti tech thing going look nothing perfect like create something new like tens millions people use billions people use like theres going bad people use okay theres know society complicated like think things net positive people world good least view yes mitigate like 1 bad people trying abuse something 99 people world good way improve world technology joining companies starting companies working right stuff hope young people youre sure like get started anything thats learn basically optimism power change easy distract critic thats almost like acknowledging thats basically everybody power fixer like chew glass look abyss thats much fun sounds think meaning whole thing life yep whats meaning life whats existence got youre trying increase amount economic freedom planet trying alleviate suffering yeah dont really think point life know somebody told know go like kind really big existential questions get little scary like stare cliff theres like theres nothing know one person told one time like know brian probably snorkel dont scuba guess think trying say like friends done right theyll go like know epic meditation retreats like theyll kind come back existential dread like whats meaning like far tell organic molecules ocean started like dividing replicating selfish gene stuff like basically ended kind like really naive algorithm thats kind trying get us survive replicate dna like every animal happened develop like really cool neocortexes sort self aware big questions maybe well create another know computers get better well create simulation inside thing think cool like basically want keep watching movie know unfold thats part want work like new limit really cool cause helped people live longer whether thats uploading brain cloud know basically get biology work strong ai work whatever one two hopefully works get keep watching movie see unfolds think thats fun dont know thats like answer guess dont think theres real purpose try fun well cool thing get write movie watch yeah thats exactly right mean thats like steve jobs quote hes like everything around invented somebody like crazy idea thought realize kind anything want thats start go start go try crazier stuff mean another one areas get like know youre think build comfort zone

piece paper like like probably every day year something almost right dont know every day like wrote lot little things started happen like right well maybe move back bay area buenos aires maybe try apply combinator whatever like started thinking ideas whatever gets fired doesnt like company goal startup thing could anything right maybe wanna publish book like something creatively whatever anyway think like within seven years probably like 10 years writing goal coinbase valuation billion dollars realm even possible within 10 years accomplish 10 years think less year think im like okay whats next goal whats okay maybe wanna get billion people accessing open financial system products every day would cool humanity thats pretty crazy goal like theres 8 billion people something right theres one eight maybe radically like make like right investments whatever like help radically extend human health span whatever right try crazier stuff dont know even doesnt work like hopefully youll advance state affairs like something interesting happen people today look people trying stuff theyre like oh god theyre theyre genius whatever like theyre idiot like one two neither one true like anybody start thinking want like go get like go something little bigger like fun universe way smiling helping write dream big theres something karma energy put world people help doors open youll notice doors opened actually shot making happen funny world yeah mean dont really subscribe like woo woo interpretations rational brain interpretation wake every day write like want get done towards longer goals larger goals mind day start notice opportunities think brian thank dreaming big thank youre incredible engineering scale trying help people world actually helping personally get crypto cause easy thank much thank much giving extremely valuable time today awesome conversation thanks awesome podcast love listen often thanks listening conversation brian armstrong support podcast please check sponsors description let leave words benjamin franklin investment knowledge pays best interest thank listening hope see next time wonder stay touch voice people without destroyed outrage wisdom dont know wisdom ive thought yeah wanna always open feedback especially people like best interests heart right become isolated like know surrounded yes people mean knows maybe like putin people like situations idea listen much try please everyone youll never get anything done mean best leaders people act believe theyre something net positive world humanity actually dont really care piss portion people almost anything youre gonna significance world today gonna piss 5 people maybe 49 people whatever maybe 60 dont know never wanna become surrounded people work say yes think like well im genius im like thats become dictator whatever also cant care much people think youll never anything thats truly authentic one thought way think really good question ive thought lot like know people generally kind hate zuck hate bill gates hate dont really hate elon well actually elon lot haters different thing measured measured looking surveys think zuck loved hated right zuckerberg loved hated hes hated think bill gates elon think like 40 hate zuck people asked elon double digits low double digits interesting look data ask right ask sometimes dont claim know people well like ive met briefly impression theyre actually smart people trying good things world theres much difference despite public perception really hated arent mean complicated question obviously zuck facebook got blamed whole election thing didnt help social media gotten lot pressure like hey arent solving societys tough problems like well theyre one company one thing ive noticed lot people like aspergers right little bit sometimes people aspergers dont really emote way think almost form like bias cognitive type something like person doesnt emote right dont trust intentions thing ive thought sometimes think leaders like maybe zuck bill gates come across like little bit pr rehearsed like theyre basically theyre giving pr approved answers elon says whatever thinks like fault even people hate says like least believe authentic ive always thought im like cause fuck sides right like come youre like saying whatever stream consciousness youll often end like pissing people team like saying tripping like regulation youve theres kinds things running public company cant say certain stuff youre pr approved answer like nobody trusts youre saying anyway something think lot dont think right answer im trying find balance internet theres premium authenticity like youre saying people really really appreciate leaders challenge make sure im authentic also dont say stupid shit thats interesting thing ive noticed interacted bunch leaders careful much surround pr folks best would say let say nice thing marketing pr folks best marketing folks extremely good understand exactly great marketing great pr authenticity showing revealing beauty opposed pr marketing fear oh dont say dont say dont start living kind pushes towards bubble cant express beautiful quirks weirdness kind stuff also cool beautiful things youre find like especially tech things like even like coinbase way reveal beauty showing things could showing theres great engineering going underneath letting nerds shine doesnt like kind commercials like happy family using coinbase send transaction flowers mom something like like could also like gritty stuff real stuff thats general observation made said talking dark moments theres people internet pissed site said might something else yeah sleep deprived like bunch people internet pissed balances fucked like people tweeting companys give money back whatever oh yeah somebody posted didnt started get customer support inquiries like like people company backed maybe like 20000 support requests people couldnt get ahold us somebody posted cell phone number reddit like like need get ahold ceo whatever cause everyones upset money remember office like late night weve working like 12 hours sleep deprived im trying hack like get bug fixed need like food office phone blowing day cause someone posted phone number internet theres like guy guy like trying deliver food needed answer phone like get food downstairs like shit gotta see thats started answering call like brian im like nope wrong number click pick next call like every finished call another call like coming like im reporter japan like asking security nope wrong number click like finally get delivery guy downstairs bring food like surviving like fix bug remember basically point night like fuck need basically curled like ball floor like cried little bit think let kind wallow self pity kind took nap five minutes like lets fucking solve like know stop like little whatever like got back sleep deprivation combined stress pressure site going everybody wants site pressure people number users growing growing growing pressure mentally mentally tough source strength time like like somebody patted back said got yeah well definitely helped co founder know theres like old saying better great relationship single better single bad relationship co founders actually blow lot companies find right co founder lucky find fred important definitely moments know like kind know width end whatever like like dude lets rally like basically carried team know couple times like really key moments advice would give startup founders particular stage surviving five five employees stage yeah well pre product market fit best advice period action produces information like keep stuff know remember like paul graham paul graham great line like think thats line like startups like sharks stop swimming die know even youre like sure like anything itll like itll produce information like people liked didnt true times something instead debating endlessly like try know like right shipped like couple times like minute shipped like knew know built wrong idea next wasnt would idea wed actually gone exercise going build like favorite analogy youre like base mountain thats shrouded fog youre looking mountain youre trying think like okay get see like three four steps ahead cause fog thick take steps unknown take three steps another three steps revealed ahead sometimes youll end local maximum youll retrace steps whatever come cliff know people life dont take steps fog unknown scary theyre like dont know fail like dont know thats going work might run money wont able get job dont know whatever reason like one things separates think entrepreneurial people kind inclination sort comfort risk tolerance actually really risky think like know least places like know go startup fails like youre going youre even valuable next employer right go raise seed round pay salary try like two years three years doesnt work go get another job like youre werent paying salary time think think people overestimate risk startup never never start seems crazy friends think silly like thats sort default nature every big startup idea basic fear kind fear see youre guy see cute girl bar fear associated coming like asking like whats actual risk exactly right shell say thanks im interested thanks guess risk like thats going mentally difficult deal rejection like mentally difficult deal failure bunch ideas excited implement realize theyre good could difficult keep pushing suppose thats life youre supposed know perseverance failures risk low thats whole time fog mountain youre looking product market fit yeah thats right know usage product keeps growing without marketing dollars anything like like people keep coming back every week month youre kind keep youre basically watching stats nothing working see little wiggles false hope metrics basically keep talking customers fixing improving product talk customers improve product talk customers improve product know try run money really scrappy youre lucky hit kind threshold like okay thing good enough hit use case itll organically start grow bit whole different set problems hit product market fit scale thing hire people know hire executive team raise money like problems totally change yeah well whole thing thats question thats fascinating back girl bar hire people like find good friends find good relationships specific case hire good people engineers executive one thing ive done lot reps hiring point coinbase 5000 people probably first 500 people something maybe range know interviewed every single one remember theres probably like dont know average maybe 10 people went process every one hired something like time 500 employees done like 5000 interviews something like burned interviews days like seven interviews day maybe know youve lots interviews maybe wouldnt get burned different kind interviews different different different youre first interviews lead rejection yeah also exhausting yeah theres whole part interview candidate experience right sometimes know right person wanna make sure good experience yes like youre exhausted youre sixth interview youre like well thanks coming wrap like youre gonna create detractor someone whos like fuck company brian rude whatever honestly work little bit early days many interviews like needed make sure people came like know made feel comfortable asked couple like warmup questions like oh getting office like find okay like week like know like factory assembly line like boom boom boom like yeah also theres moment cause ive interviewed bunch people like teams stuff theres also moment early know gonna good fit still land plane kind stuff could get really really really exhausting yeah anyway sorry yeah basically tried weve tried many things years make interviews efficient cause huge time sink team know basically well usually get like 25 minutes ive seen youre trying hire like big team lets say know people like contractors something necessarily full time employees ive seen people actually 10 minute interviews even interview like thousand people almost like week something im sure quite works let little less basically get six six done hour youre need get team 30 contractors whatever purpose youre talking full time employees usually like 25 minute know youre oftentimes like one thing weve done well put like google form online like put basic hurdles like know ask put answer check spreadsheet correct like funny examples early days coinbase wed put like brain teasers stuff dont anymore like normal interviews references kinds things ask interviews know usually like like think need person accomplish role right get really specific like usually something pretty hard ill ask question like tell time x tell hardest hardest kind problem youve solve specifically overcome right im asking see actually stuff need get done im also kind asking like culture questions im interviewing im trying see like concise communicators give clear answer stop talking people like ramble like five 10 minutes ask first question people know theyre interrupters like church interruption like wont stop talking interrupt im always patient wait thats weird im looking see humility like know ill tell us people ill tell time something went really wrong like conflict someone team im kind looking part solution still holding onto like blame criticism like well told shouldnt way didnt listen know like bad signs im looking yeah get job done work together team communicate effectively fit cultural values know kinds things yeah mean theres cause ive even help podcast also mit ive done bunch hiring always looking said brain teasers kinds simple questions reveal lot information always challenging used still ask question think better work hard work smart know idea ive think ive matured kind believe people say work smart question dont actually work smart right textbook answer better work smart reality people havent actually ever done anything say work smart theyre like havent really struggled general belief time order discover means work smart efficient work ass really fail lot failure feels like hard work always suspicious people would say work smart would want interrogate question also know learned people exceptionally exceptionally efficient really know means work smart even young age like cant disqualify based dig deeper interesting people ive ever worked would say work hard unapologetically theyre usually ones know efficient interesting thing like ive always searched questions nature see get person reveal something profound brief question possible know course theres basic attention detail brain teasers stuff like depending role programming see solve tricky puzzle like one doesnt require lot effort requires certain nonlinear way thinking mean maybe dont want reveal questions sometimes find leaning said like solve hard problem past talk thats one know started brain teasers periodically coinbase got away relatively quickly think one tough one actually think show somebody kind performs pressure dont think super reliable indicator theres people really good typical work situation thats typical work situation somebody puts spot like live interview sometimes people get nervous cant think clearly like dont computer front whatever normally use yeah im little skeptical brain teaser thing whole yeah whole question like lot universities getting rid know entrance exams youre hiring right universities sometimes becoming less reliable indicator like university ive heard companies havent done yet ive heard companies actually creating like college grads like basically exams like standardized testing almost get people door degree almost like doesnt mean used whole topic yeah thats fascinating fascinating trying hire great team also help find right place work yeah like two way street right found product market fit coinbase become today ooh let ask engineering question actually sort ruby wallet days interesting challenges engineering things solved engineering regulation financial hiring lawyers post product market fit yeah lot scaling got build actual company remember still writing lot code hiring like maybe 25 people something remember one investors came one day like brian much time spending writing code like maybe 50 something like much time spending hiring people like probably 20 like think need flip numbers like company going scale youre ceo dont need writing code every day youre going transition stuff like even people cant stuffs locked head maybe theyre going well first six months something like dont start transition youre never going build real company going youre going bottleneck know like lot founders took like really internalize lesson id always heard people say know still holding much decision making probably still way like even day coinbase continually push decision making org like even 5000 people like owners things temptation people push become bottleneck anyway yeah basically need make sure enough money dont die theres kind downturn hit break even profitability position periodically profitable periods crypto would go unprofitable kind manage psychology balance sheet make sure didnt like die downturn lot crypto companies basically professionalize whole bunch services quickly thrown together like 20 year olds right whether cybersecurity like okay get like really senior experienced cybersecurity person someone whos senior cant get hands dirty come company 25 50 people get finance person come finances mess like didnt even really know much money certain times stuff mean embarrassing say true like remember point raised think like series c something like think bank accounts put like 25 million like different bank account none stuff touched actual operations business cause like operations messy needed hire new finance person like id heard horror stories actually startups thought x amount money turned way less whole thing insolvent like three weeks wanted padding least like right least count save us go like super negative right mean like cheap hack like could come could hire like real cfo finance team like okay got arms around much cash sounds silly high volume money coming anyway ordering hiring way like many engineers early said cfo didnt even cfo bit like landscape hiring building company engineering focused well lets see mean first person hired like need solve customer support brought someone staying till midnight every night trying customer support got engineers think maybe sixth hire something like recruiter cause turned need build hire person hire people turned great force multiplier youre going list eventually want hire senior people needed legal compliance needed really badly cause kinds questions legality hard find legal people work crypto like serious adults cause cutting edge new world yeah mean nobody like nobody three years experience cause around years yeah finding people adjacent fields theres certain personality type people willing join early companies structure cant really commit youre going team boss whatever like everythings chaos flux takes yeah hiring one hardest things early stage sure got find people crazy enough join journey one interesting things coinbase youve written weve talked well talk bit youre focused mission yeah youre kind think simplifies things makes hiring easier makes working coinbase easier makes mean similar elon thing pretty clear pretty clear suppose whats mission coinbase well increase economic freedom world economic freedom yeah economic freedom term kind like gdp economists use basically measure different countries around world looks things like property rights enforced free trade currency stable start companies wanna start join ones wanna join corruption bribery prevalent relatively free theres several different organizations basically score countries economic freedom really cool thing economic freedom basically positively correlates things want society like higher growth economy also things like higher self reported happiness citizens better treatment environment better income poorest 10 people negatively correlates things dont want society like corruption bribery war even things like pretty crazy provocative idea give people good property rights rule law allow trade basically encourages good stuff whole society benefits like one things may noticed growing various places spent year living buenos aires argentina went hyperinflation theres certain like pessimism creep countries dont economic freedom basically like everyone bit vibe like dont stick head dont try hard could gone tomorrow like things really valuable life family friends past better future dont really people dont try many dont try hard youre really sure actually keep upside labor try hard dont try hard whereas america historically high economic freedom countries people basically like try stuff theyre like good people ill get keep part improve lot life children community whatever realized read bitcoin white paper long time ago least hunch time like might really powerful piece technology inject good financial infrastructure countries around world dont basically good economic freedom principles like property rights things like countries world long smartphone crypto got invented everybody could economic freedom crypto kind really well suited economic freedom want property rights based like crypto remember 12 word phrase app phone store much wealth want cant taken away even theres like refugees need flee wanna take wealth cant often traditional financial system crypto lets right crypto inherently global allows free trade cross border payments makes easy accept payments people globally provides stable currency everyone'"
